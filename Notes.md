Thursday 2015 September 17
==========================
Initial meeting with Pat about this project.  See my notes.


Monday 2015 September 21
========================
Starting from the data analysis guide sent from Pat.
Run a number of commands, which I combine together in the script `xmm_repro`.
In simple script form, assuming you're in a directory with the folder ./$obsid

This first batch of commands ingests and prepares your data, creating level 1
event files for all detectors.
I have run these commands for all three XMM obsids with G309.2-0.6 data.

    # Contained in script, use `source sasinit`
    # -----------------------------------------
    heainit
    source /soft/XMM/xmmsas/setsas.csh
    setenv SAS_CCFPATH /proj/xmm/ccf


    # Contained in script, use `xmm_repro $obsid`
    # -------------------------------------------
    cd "$obsid/ODF"
    setenv SAS_ODF `pwd`
    gunzip *.gz
    mkdir "repro"
    cd "repro"

    cifbuild
    setenv SAS_CCF `pwd`/ccf.cif
    odfingest

    setenv SAS_ODF `pwd`/`ls -1 *SUM.SAS`
    emchain >& emchain.log
    epchain >& epchain.log

    ln -s P*M1*MIEV*.FIT m1_evt1.fits
    ln -s P*M2*MIEV*.FIT m2_evt1.fits
    ln -s P*PN*PIEV*.FIT pn_evt1.fits


    # When re-initializing sas environment
    # after having run ODF chain already
    # ------------------------------------
    setenv SAS_ODF `pwd`/$obsid/ODF
    setenv SAS_ODF `pwd`/`ls -1 $obsid/ODF/repro/*SUM.SAS`
    setenv SAS_CCF `pwd`/$obsid/ODF/repro/ccf.cif

Obsid 0087940901 does NOT have MOS or PN data, only RGS exposures, 2ks. Not sure why?
Therefore we're unable to run epchain as it errors out.  But emchain works, so
I guess that handles both MOS and RGS data.

Thursday 2015 September 24
==========================

Continuing with D. T. Reese's XMM cookbook (the data analysis PDF from Pat).
In what follows, I work with obsid 0087940201 in $obsid/ODF/repro/

First, make lightcurves: `mos1_ltcrv.fits, mos2_ltcrv.fits, pn_ltcrv.fits`.

    evselect table=m1_evt1.fits withrateset=yes rateset=mos1_ltcrv.fits maketimecolumn=yes timecolumn=TIME timebinsize=10 makeratecolumn=yes
    evselect table=m2_evt1.fits withrateset=yes rateset=mos2_ltcrv.fits maketimecolumn=yes timecolumn=TIME timebinsize=10 makeratecolumn=yes
    evselect table=pn_evt1.fits withrateset=yes rateset=pn_ltcrv.fits maketimecolumn=yes timecolumn=TIME timebinsize=10 makeratecolumn=yes

Inspect data with dsplot:

    dsplot table=mos1_ltcrv.fits x=TIME y=RATE &

MOS1 looks like lots of early flaring, maybe first 20-30% of obsid.  One flare at ~75% through.
First order fix would be to cut all before t = 1.5365e08, and excise t = 1.15384e08 to 1.15387e08
MOS2 looks like MOS1.
PN looks similar, but flares (and later flare) are shaped differently. Very clearly more counts.


Filter data by PATTERN and some standard set of flags (`#XMMEA_EM, #XMMEA_EP`).
Commands also set energy ranges, 0.2-12 keV for MOS and 0.2-15 keV for PN.
Note that PATTERN indicates types of event signals observed on the MOS or PN
CCDs, NOT the count rate.  See the links:
* [EPIC-mos event patterns](http://xmm.esac.esa.int/external/xmm_user_support/documentation/sas_usg/USG/MOSevtlist.html)
  "[Soft] X-rays mainly generate patterns 0 to 12 corresponding to compact
  regions of X-ray energy deposition... For imaging mode data patterns 0 to 12
  are the canonical set of valid X-ray events which are well calibrated.
  Selection of these patterns constitutes the best trade-off between detection
  efficiency and spectral resolution."
* [EPIC-pn event patterns](http://xmm.esac.esa.int/external/xmm_user_support/documentation/sas_usg/USG/pnevtlist.html)
  "For spectral analysis however, only single and double (pattern 0 to 4) should be used"

I got that confused at first and changed the PATTERN filters to <=11 (MOS) and
<=34 (PN), which subsequently messed up my attempts to generate RMF and ARF
files for spectral analysis!

    # Note change in the column #XMMEA_EM to #XMMEA_EP from MOS to PN
    evselect table=m1_evt1.fits:EVENTS withfilteredset=yes expression='(PATTERN<=12)&&#XMMEA_EM&&(PI in [200:12000])' filteredset=mos1-filt.fits filtertype=expression keepfilteroutput=yes
    evselect table=m2_evt1.fits:EVENTS withfilteredset=yes expression='(PATTERN<=12)&&#XMMEA_EM&&(PI in [200:12000])' filteredset=mos2-filt.fits filtertype=expression keepfilteroutput=yes
    evselect table=pn_evt1.fits:EVENTS withfilteredset=yes expression='(PATTERN<=4)&&#XMMEA_EP&&(PI in [200:15000])' filteredset=pn-filt.fits filtertype=expression keepfilteroutput=yes


Make binned images.  For Kes73...
On MOS1, Reese uses binsize=40.  One pixel = 1.1" x 1.1", compare to PSF HEW ~14".
On PN, Reese uses binsize=40 too. One pixel = 4.1", compare to PSF HEW ~15.2".
Ok let's do 40 for now, fiddle with it later.

    evselect table=mos1-filt.fits:EVENTS withimageset=yes imageset=mos1-filt-img.fits xcolumn=X ycolumn=Y imagebinning=binSize ximagebinsize=40 yimagebinsize=40
    evselect table=mos2-filt.fits:EVENTS withimageset=yes imageset=mos2-filt-img.fits xcolumn=X ycolumn=Y imagebinning=binSize ximagebinsize=40 yimagebinsize=40
    evselect table=pn-filt.fits:EVENTS withimageset=yes imageset=pn-filt-img.fits xcolumn=X ycolumn=Y imagebinning=binSize ximagebinsize=40 yimagebinsize=40

Looks pretty good!  Fuzzy blob...
Generate exposure maps as follows:

    atthkgen atthkset=atthk.fits  # Creates attitude information to get good time intervals (GTI)
    eexpmap imageset=mos1-filt-img.fits pimin=2000 pimax=8000 attitudeset=atthk.fits eventset=mos1-filt.fits expimageset=mos1_expmap.fits
    eexpmap imageset=mos2-filt-img.fits pimin=2000 pimax=8000 attitudeset=atthk.fits eventset=mos2-filt.fits expimageset=mos2_expmap.fits
    eexpmap imageset=pn-filt-img.fits pimin=2000 pimax=8000 attitudeset=atthk.fits eventset=pn-filt.fits expimageset=pn_expmap.fits

Select regions for spectral extraction.  Shapes selection is defined by XMM SAS
selectlib spec (http://xmm.esa.int/sas/current/doc/selectlib/node15.html).
It appears that DS9 physical/detector coordinates are the same (looking at
`mos1-filt-img.fits` and similar), and these coordinates correspond to straight
X/Y for XMM SAS.  Coordinates are:

    SNR ellipse:
	Center: 26260.5, 25100.5
	Radii: 6360, 4200
    Background ellipse:
	Center: 28604.5, 37740.5
	Radii: 6920, 3864

The resulting spectral extraction commands are:

    especget filestem=mos1src table=mos1-filt.fits srcexp='((X,Y) IN ellipse(26260.5, 25100.5, 6360, 42000, 0))' backexp='((X,Y) IN ellipse(28604.5, 37740.5, 6920, 3864, 0))' extendedsource=yes ;
    especget filestem=mos2src table=mos2-filt.fits srcexp='((X,Y) IN ellipse(26260.5, 25100.5, 6360, 42000, 0))' backexp='((X,Y) IN ellipse(28604.5, 37740.5, 6920, 3864, 0))' extendedsource=yes ;
    especget filestem=pnsrc table=pn-filt.fits srcexp='((X,Y) IN ellipse(26260.5, 25100.5, 6360, 42000, 0))' backexp='((X,Y) IN ellipse(28604.5, 37740.5, 6920, 3864, 0))' extendedsource=yes ;

NOTE: when I ran this (afternoon Thurs Sep 24) with filtered images that used weird PATTERN selections, I got errors:

    # MOS1, MOS2 run
    ** especget::rmfgen: warning (NonStandardPatterns), Non-standard pattern range - assuming energy pattern fraction = 1.0
    ... more logging ...
    ** especget::rmfgen: error (InvalidPatterns), An RMF cannot be produced for the pattern range in the DSS

which killed the MOS especget runs.  The PN run seemed to hang for about 1.5
hours creating the ARF, which isn't supposed to take that long.
It appears that tasks rmfgen, arfgen (which underly especget) cannot handle
non-standard patterns.  See the "NonStandardPattern" warning for arfgen:
[link](http://xmm.esac.esa.int/sas/current/doc/arfgen/node34.html).

I finally figured this out in the evening.  These output spectra will not be
usable for science, because we have not excised flares and made no attempt to
remove background etc.  So I need to figure out how to do that next.


Friday 2015 September 25 -- Weds 2015 September 30
==================================================

Inspect spectra in XSPEC with commands:

    XSPEC12>data mos1src_src.ds
    XSPEC12>setplot en
    XSPEC12>ignore **-0.2, 15.-**
    XSPEC12>cpd /xw
    XSPEC12>setplot rebin 5 5  # Pat recommends rebinning to 15 or 25
    XSPEC12>plot ldata

    XSPEC12>iplot
    PLT> rescale x 1.5 2.  # Zooming in on a faint Si line
    PLT> re y 0.01 .1

Good.  Now automatic flare filtering, to obtain GTIs:

    espfilt eventset=mos1-filt.fits method=histogram clobber=no -V 6
    espfilt eventset=mos2-filt.fits method=histogram clobber=no -V 6
    espfilt eventset=pn-filt.fits method=histogram clobber=no -V 6

PROBLEM: mos1 works but mos2 and pn fail... use verbose flag "-V 6" to explore.
Someone else had a similar error, occurring at same place in log.
RESOLUTION (much later, Weds 2015 Sep 30): tasks run successfully on statler, which has 8
GB RAM to treble's 4 GB.  Should have tried this earlier...

Output files from espfilt, where an example filestem is P0087940201M1S001 and XXX = 001, 002, 003:

    P{obsid}{M1,M2,PN}S{XXX}-objimg -- unfiltered "raw" image
    P{obsid}{M1,M2,PN}S{XXX}-objlc -- unfiltered light curve
    P{obsid}{M1,M2,PN}S{XXX}-corlc -- unfiltered corner light curve

    P{obsid}{M1,M2,PN}S{XXX}-hist.qdp -- histogram + lightcurves, qdp commands (very nice plots)
    P{obsid}{M1,M2,PN}S{XXX}-gti -- good time intervals in FITS and txt formats

    P{obsid}{M1,M2,PN}S{XXX}-objevlifilt -- filtered event list
    P{obsid}{M1,M2,PN}S{XXX}-objimgfilt -- image in det coords, pretty clean, SNR pops right out
    P{obsid}{M1,M2,PN}S{XXX}-corevlifilt  -- filtered corner event list
    P{obsid}{M1,M2,PN}S{XXX}-corimgfilt -- filtered corner image, looks empty?...

PROBLEM: I'm confused by the warning for PN that states data are in window
mode, so no corner files are generated.  XMM Archive states that the PN
exposure for this obsid is in extended full frame, not {large/small} window.
Why the discrepancy?
RESOLUTION: I had removed all the `OUT_OF_FOV` events because I'm operating on already-filtered data!
{mos1,mos2,pn}-filt.fits were generated with evselect using the `XMMEA_{EM,EP}` flags.

Generally Useful tools: fgui, fv, fhelp
Tools to manipulate spectra: mathpha, addrmf, addarf, dmhedit, grppha
(see scripts from Brian Williams, from Tycho project)

TODO: where do the exposure maps come into all this?


Monday 2015 October 5 -- Tuesday 2015 October 6
===============================================

Running ESAS and piecing together more about how things work...

Spectra after flare removal
---------------------------

Diversion (for mtg with Pat): created some spectra using espfilt-ered files
despite the fact that output from espfilt had some errors, due to lack of
corner pixels.  Should be OK for histogram method.  I suspect that especget
does NOT account for spatially varying / filterwheel background at all.

    especget filestem=mos1src_espfilt table=P0087940201M1S001-objevlifilt.FIT \
	srcexp='((X,Y) IN ellipse(26260.5, 25100.5, 6360, 42000, 0))' \
	backexp='((X,Y) IN ellipse(28604.5, 37740.5, 6920, 3864, 0))' \
	extendedsource=yes ;
    especget filestem=mos2src_espfilt table=P0087940201M2S002-objevlifilt.FIT \
	srcexp='((X,Y) IN ellipse(26260.5, 25100.5, 6360, 42000, 0))' \
	backexp='((X,Y) IN ellipse(28604.5, 37740.5, 6920, 3864, 0))' \
	extendedsource=yes ;
    especget filestem=pnsrc_espfilt table=P0087940201PNS003-objevlifilt.FIT \
	srcexp='((X,Y) IN ellipse(26260.5, 25100.5, 6360, 42000, 0))' \
	backexp='((X,Y) IN ellipse(28604.5, 37740.5, 6920, 3864, 0))' \
	extendedsource=yes ;

Result: these look almost the same as the very simply filtered spectra (no
explicit attempt to get GTIs without flares).
Yes, I looked at spectra, GTI ratios are something like (18.4 ks)/(30 ks) for
PN, and (27.3 ks)/(39.3 ks) for MOS1.  Nevertheless, main features are
unchanged.

Instrumental lines are removed, crudely, via background spectrum subtraction.
Since flares should affect FOV somewhat evenly, the background subtraction takes out flares as well.
The nice thing is that flares are removed, but photons from the source during flaring time are still kept.
But, subtracting as (flare + flare-epsilon1 + source) - (flare + flare-epsilon2) ~ source + flare-epsilon3
may heighten noise and assumes (1) clean sky background, and (2) flare affecting FOV uniformly.  These are not terrible assumptions by any means.

I ran a quick error analysis (see bottom) and it seems better to remove GTIs, in our case.


More on ESAS and pipeline/methodology layout
--------------------------------------------

Things to worry about (G309.2-0.6):
* Flares -- yes, about 25% of time (cut MOS 40ks to 27ks; PN 30ks to 18ks)
* Bad events -- yes, filtering the usual is fine.
* OOT events -- yes, problem for the bright O/B star
* Pileup -- ? unsure...

Current "chain" of ESAS commands I'm using (in script `esas_run`):

	epchain withoutoftime=true >& epchain_oot.log
	epchain >& epchain.log
	emchain >& emchain.log
	mos-filter >& mos-filter.log

NOTES learned the hard way (basically, how many times can Aaron fail to run ESAS correctly):

0. For quiescent particle background step (`{mos,pn}{-,_}{spectra,back}`),
   downloaded: esas-caldb-sasv13.tar.gz (1.5 GB) from the XMM SOC FTP
   `ftp://xmm.esac.esa.int/pub/ccf/constituents/extras/esas_caldb/`.
   DO NOT gunzip files; ESAS expects .gz files and will fail dramatically otherwise.
1. filter steps must run on statler or computer w/ more memory than treble, else evselect tasks in espfilt will fail.
   One sign of bad run is if mos-filter flags "anomalous" CCD state in all MOS2 CCDs because no files were produced.
2. If mos/pn-filter are re-run, need to move event files back to original place
   (3 files for MOS1, MOS2, PN event lists and 1 file for PN OOT event list)
   Here's a diff of ls -l output, before and after running {mos,pn}-filter, showing the emchain/epchain names:

	< -rw-r--r-- 1 atran mp  75M Oct  5 18:22 P0087940201PNS003OOEVLI0000.FIT

   Keep this diff, because you may need to re-locate these files...

3. I originally ran {mos,pn}-spectra with ellipses in (X,Y) coordinates,
   thinking that it's simply used for evselect so shouldn't break anything...
   Pat warned that XMM SAS (and definitely ESAS) doesn't like rectangular
   or square regions.
   So I created plaintext src/bgd files with the selections:

	src: &&((X,Y) IN ellipse(26260.5, 25100.5, 6360, 42000, 0))
	bgd: &&((X,Y) IN ellipse(28604.5, 37740.5, 6920, 3864, 0))

   But {mos,pn}-spectra runs failed.
   I gave up and created circular spectra in DETX,DETY coordinates, and cleared
   out ALL the files in my repro directory, to run ESAS with a clean slate.
   It seemed to work.
   So I haven't determined whether the region selections caused ESAS to fail.
   But it seems plausible.

4. {mos,pn}-spectra take a long time to run.  pn-spectra took 1hr 20min,
   mos-spectra took 50min. for each MOS camera.
   I think on treble mos-spectra was faster (20-30 min?) since I might be
   running less stuff, vs. Josh is using statler these days.

5. From source code: the event file should be cleaned of bad time intervals,
   bad pixels, and the like, but MUST include the corner pixels.  (So
   PATTERN<=12 is good, but FLAG==0 is not!).

5. I think the notion of using background/source region selections for ESAS
   is not correct.

I still don't know what exactly they do with the filterwheel spectra...

Anyways, result:
* use `mos1S001_obj.pi` with `mos1S001_back.pi` as background (BACKFILE).
  also manually link to RMF/ARF files.

Model the rest yourself!...

Lots of exploration over Mon,Tues,Weds of Oct 5-7, trying to figure out ESAS

================================================

Outstanding questions / things to check:
* epreject, epnoise

## What's REALLY in this quiescent particle background?

Here I CAREFULLY walk through the procedure traced out by Snowden and Kuntz, in
their 2008? A&A paper.

(snowden et al.'s) Motivation: analysis of diffuse emission that fills the FOV
(i.e., where there is no such thing as a "background" region)

Procedure:

1. extract spectra from all chip corners of your observation
   (`mos{pref}-*oc.pi`, where `*` indicates CCD 2-7)

2. extract spectra from all chip corners of all public observations (NOT FWC),
   IF the hardness ratio of other data matches your observation.  This is an
   "augmentation" of the `-oc.pi` data, NOT FWC data, to improve
   signal-to-noise.  Uses 42 Ms of public XMM data, since corners are always
   outside FOV.
   This appears to be carried out in the mos/pn-back stage, not in
   mos/pn-spectra.
   So I can't verify this, without going into the source code.
     The relevant file is {mos1,pn,mos2}-qpb.fits.gz

3. Assume "ratios of spectra from different regions of a chip are temporally
   invariant".
   - Extract `mos{pref}-*ff.pi` (FWC data for piece of region in chip `*`, 1-7)
   - Extract `mos{pref}-*fc.pi` (FWC data for corner of each chip, `*` is 2-7)

   Multiply -oc.pi (observation corner) by ratio of -ff.pi / -fc.pi
   To get ratio, smooth -ff.pi and -fc.pi slightly and then take the ratio.

   Maybe you can say, alternately, that we take -ff.pi * -oc.pi/-fc.pi (scale
   the FWC spectrum in your region, by the ratio of corner spectra) (although
   the smoothing/ratio operation means the operands don't commute)
   "This ''corrects'' the unexposed-region spectra to the shape of the spectrum
   in the region of interest."
   GOOD, this all makes sense.

4. Need to handle MOS1 CCD1 and MOS2 CCD1 specially.  Central CCD doesn't have
   any corner pixels!

   In MOS1, we empirically observe that total QPB spectrum in CCD1 is similar
   to CCDs 2,3,6,7.
   In MOS2, CCD1 is similar to CCDs 3,4,6.

   Take ratio of -1ff.pi / {-2fc.pi, -3fc.pi, -6fc.pi, -7fc.pi}
   (ratio of FWC region / FWC corners)
   Then, multiply by {-2oc.pi, -3oc.pi, -6oc.pi, -7oc.pi}.
   Basically, `-1ff.pi * {-*oc.pi/-*fc.pi}` takes the FWC data in our src
   region, then scales by the ratio of (corner obs)/(corner FWC) data for the
   chips w/ similar spectra to the central chip.

     (source FWC, ccd 1) * (corner obs)/(corner FWC)

   Assume the ratio of obs/FWC spectra is the same in corner, as it is in the
   region of interest (ROI).  Now, assume that ratio of obs/FWC spectra is same
   for MOS1-1 as it is for MOS1-{2,3,6,7}.  Then we can easily scale the FWC
   spectrum for ROI, to expected normalization for the actual observation.

   So that's what the code does.  I don't know precisely how it does the ratios
   for multiple CCDs, but hopefully there's some sensible weighting.

5. Now, combine the spectra from all these chips (`-ff.pi * -oc.pi/-fc.pi`),
   weighting appropriately by RMF/ARF/whatever, to form a single background
   region.

Note about ESAS CALDB fwc.fits.gz vs qpb.fits.gz.  The file sizes look wrong.
From Kuntz/Snowden Table 4, the augmentation data (qpb) should have ~1.5
million cts/ccd, vs. ~0.2 million cts/ccd for FWC data.  But, FWC data file is
123 MB to QPB's 34 MB.  Why?

1. Unzip files.  fwc.fits is 187M to qpb.fits 405M (ratio a bit above 2)
2. Look at qpb.fits file using `fv` tool.  There are six tables for each of
   CCDs 2-6.  Each CCD has data from 7202 observations with information on:
   - obsid, revolution, filter, instrument, RA/dec
   - total time, clean time
   - rate, rate err
   - hardness, hardness err
   - spectrum
   There are 1.4 million counts in MOS1 FWC vs. 9.7 million in MOS1 obs
   database, according to Table 4 of Kuntz/Snowden.  But QPB data are stored as
   spectra: ~500 channels x 7202 obsids = 3.6 million data points.

Everything checks out. Uncompressed file size ratios are about
right (bit above 2) and it makes sense that spectra (qpb) file compresses
better than the plain event list.

Resulting interpretation: the QPB is a correctly weighted (FWC to obs)
extraction of FWC data in the ROI.  Kuntz/Snowden 2008 claim that FWC data used
are only those with similar hardness ratios, as justified in their paper.
They explicitly exclude the Al/Si line region and apply a simple continuum fit.
"It is unwise merely to exclude the region containing these lines as the low
energy wings are quite extensive and so affect the lower energy data."


Possible concern: what if the incident particle background is different due to
the closed filterwheel (1.05 mm Al)?

* Corner spectrum should be the same regardless of filterwheel; energetic
  particles focused by mirrors wouldn't hit corners.

* The ROI may experience a different spectrum.  We ask,
  1. what is relative flux of particles via FOV, to particles outside FOV
  2. how does FWC attenuate that.  And, for particles incident on telescope
     structure causing K-alpha fluorescence:
  3. does FWC positioning affect incident flux or not?

  I don't know the answers to 1 and 2.  For 3, my hope is that it is
  negligible, being a small element; moreover, it most effectively impedes
  particles traveling down the boresight -- but these are should _not_ be the
  particles that cause instrumental line fluorescence.

  "Fourth, the mask protecting the unexposed pixels from cosmic X-rays also
  protects them from the softest and most highly temporally variable component
  of the particle background, the ''soft proton flares''."

  So, obviously, QPB cannot account for soft protons intrinsic to observation.
  What about stable background flux of soft protons / soft particles?

  I really do not know for sure.  But, I'll guess it's a small effect...


## Beyond the QPB

After the QPB, we must deal with instrumental lines + additional background (in
particular, sky X-ray background).

Instrumental background varies a lot.  Al line is bright over most of MOS with
some spots (CCD edges, seemingly random streaks/corners) not as bright.  Si
line is bright on edges of CCD1.  Au is concentrated near bottom of MOS (CCDs
7,2).  Fe,Cr are strong at far corners (CCDs 4,5,7,2).

We could get a ratio of lines in the ROI, from FWC closed data.  But we
wouldn't know how to scale it.
* The incident photon/particle spectrum causing K-alpha fluorescence could be
  different when the FW is removed.

## Region selection + region files

Attempting to get consistent regions in all detectors by converting RA/dec to
XMM DETX/DETY.
NOTE: easiest to select regions from PPS processed image
P0087940201EPX000OIMAGE8000.fit
which I have done for these new src/bkg
regions.

In sky coords (fk5), here's a basic ds9 region covering most of the remnant:
 
	circle(13:46:47.553, -62:51:02.52, 239.76")

this region just butts up against the bright star HD11xxxx, trying to get as
much extended emission as possible.  It does miss extended emission to the west.
At least a few point sources are caught by this circle -- not much we can do
given the foreground star cluster.  Maybe we should run the point source
removal tool.

Two possible tools for coordinate conversion are ecoordconv and esky2det
Convert to XMM sky (X,Y) coordinates, and
then to individual detector coordinates:

I updated files `0087940201_esas/ODF/repro/reg{m1,m2,pn}.txt` with new DETX/DETY regions.

Here are three circles around the remnant periphery that should capture a decent background...

    circle(13:47:42.885, -62:44:57.88, 125.41")
    circle(13:46:33.606, -62:42:02.47, 113.572")
    circle(13:47:32.693, -62:56:46.10, 125.41")

Radii are 2508.2, 2271.44, 2508.2.
These explicitly exclude stars, although remnant circle certainly contains lots of stars...

OK, let's try generating some spectra!

Started around 12:33 pm.  Finished around 1:33pm.
Now group some spectra.

grppha

OK!  Repeated this process for all spectra to obtain:

    mos1S001-obj-src-grp.pi
    mos1S001-obj-bkg-grp.pi
    pnS003-obj-src-grp.pi
    pnS003-obj-bkg-grp.pi

Now, attempt to model background (mos1S001-obj-bkg-grp.pi) and see how far I can get.
* Al K-alpha: 1.49 keV line with zero width
* Si K-alpha: 1.75 keV line with zero width
* galactic XRB: powerlaw
* extragalactic XRB: thermal (ray, apec)

Result: did not get very far...

Discussed some at group meeting.  Lots of discussion with Josh afterwards,
details about absorption, etc.

It turns out, looking at my unfolded spectrum, that it ticks way up, so as to
be not model-able by the components I'm working with.
Next logical step is to re-run pipeline on different observation and see if
same issue occurs.

AFTER A LOT OF FIDDLING, figured out how to use nohup and kill nohup processes...

    nohup perl -we '$| = 1 ; my $i = 0 ; while ( $i < 120 ) { my @lt = localtime ; print "hi! It is @lt!\n" ; sleep 1 ; $i++ ; }' > nohuptest.txt &

For spectra generation... I modified `esas_run` to run mos/pn-filter, then get spectra (mos/pn-spectra, mos/pn-back).
* sshed into statler
* sourced sasinit and sas_setpaths
* ran command:

    nohup source esas_run > nohup_esas_run_20151020.txt &

* Now running mos1S001 spectra... TIME TO SLEEP UGH


Tuesday 2015 October 20
=======================

Post-mortem: spectra finished running about an hour later, it turns out the runs for PN segfaulted?!
Grouped all the spectra and investigated further.  Same as before, assign
rmf/arf files, group min 50, and check out in XSPEC.

    mos1S001-obj-src-grp.pi
    mos1S001-obj-bkg-grp.pi
    grppha mos2S002-obj-src.pi mos2S002-obj-src-grp.pi 'chkey BACKFILE mos2S002-back-src.pi & chkey RESPFILE mos2S002-src.rmf & chkey ANCRFILE mos2S002-src.arf & group min 50 & exit' 
    grppha mos2S002-obj-bkg.pi mos2S002-obj-bkg-grp.pi 'chkey BACKFILE mos2S002-back-bkg.pi & chkey RESPFILE mos2S002-bkg.rmf & chkey ANCRFILE mos2S002-bkg.arf & group min 50 & exit' 

Observation: 
* mos1S001-obj-bkg-grp.pi from 0087940201 (Hughes) looks awful, extremely sharp rise at/above 5 keV.
* mos2S002-obj-bkg-grp.pi from 0087940201 (Hughes) looks awful, like MOS1
* pnS003-obj-bkg-grp.pi from 0087940201 (Hughes) looks awful, like MOS1.  Same extremely sharp rise above 5 keV. WHY?
* mos1S001-obj-bkg-grp.pi from 0551000201 (Motch) looks OK, appears to be a very slight trend up in the unfolded spectrum
* mos2S002-obj-bkg-grp.pi from 0551000201 (Motch) looks OK, similar to MOS1 

PLAN:
0. clean up all these damn notes.
1. re-run 00879... from scratch
2. re-run with epreject, epnoise on (see if that helps the low energy hump)


I deleted everything in `0087940201_esas/ODF/repro/` save for the DETX/DETY region selections.
Now I'll re-run `esas_run` from the very top.  Executing from the top on statler.
PID is 14938.

`0087940201_esas/ODF/repro/mos1S001-obj-src-grp.pi`

instrumental).  This is a simple phabs x vrnei fit.  Confirms Rakowski's

ANYWAYS, back to the main problem.

ALL of the data for 0087940201 show this problem.
The data for 0551000201 might show a small uptick, but it's subtle enough to
look like it's within error.  So for now I'll assume that this problem is
confined to 0087940201.

What's going on?

1. I use the same code for 0551000201 and re-ran the commands from scratch for
   0087940201.  So it's unlikely to be a (direct) bug in the data reduction.

   It's possible that the scripts being used are tripping up somehow.
   Run evselect and PATTERN filter by hand for spectra.
   I try successively more restrictive filters:
   - PATTERN <= 12, `#XMMEA_EM`
   - PATTERN <= 12, `#XMMEA_SM`
   - PATTERN <= 12, FLAG == 0
   Recalling that

	XMMEA_EM= '(FLAG & 0x766ba000) == 0' / Select good MOS events
	XMMEA_SM= '(FLAG & 0xfffffeff) == 0' / Select good MOS events for spectra
		compared to 'FLAG == 0', XMMEA_SM allows 0x00000100 (CLOSE_TO_DEADPIX) to pass through.

   with the following commands:

	evselect table=mos1S001-clean.fits:EVENTS filtertype=expression \
	    expression='(PATTERN<=12) && (PI in [200:12000]) && #XMMEA_EM' \
	    filtertype=expression withfilteredset=yes keepfilteroutput=yes \

	evselect table=mos1S001-clean.fits:EVENTS filtertype=expression \
	    expression='(PATTERN<=12) && (PI in [200:12000]) && #XMMEA_SM' \
	    filtertype=expression withfilteredset=yes keepfilteroutput=yes \

   Run as a nohup script, started around 19:10pm:

    [1] 13285

Looking at spectra, after finishing:

	mos1src_especget_XMMEA_SM_pattern12_src.ds -- shows tail
	mos1src_especget_perfect_src.ds -- SAME PROBLEM?!

So it's not due to unfiltered events.

Even non-ESAS-processed data (from my walkthrough of Dan T. Reese's procedure)
show the same issue.

2. I use the right sky regions in all cases?
   * MOS1 hughes - yep (source)
   * MOS2 hughes - yep (source)
   * PN hughes - yep (source)
   Since this issue occurs for both source and bkg spectra I'll take this as being OK.
   Corroborated by the fact that spectra shows spectrum consistent w/ Rakowski+ paper.

3. soft proton flare filtering was OK?
   * Hughes (MOS1) looks OK
   * Motch (MOS1) looks OK, but definitely some contamination (needs a tighter cut)


Sunday 2015 October 25
======================

Reviewing this problem so far...

The final step I can take would be to download the data again, apply a very
basic proton-flare filter, and check simply extracted spectra (not worrying
about the filterwheel-extracted QPB).  Let's try this.
IF that doesn't work -- consider excising the affected data?

    # from /data/mpofls/atran/research/xmm/
    mkdir 0087940201_redl
    cd 0087940201_redl
    curl -o files.tar "http://nxsa.esac.esa.int/nxsa-sl/servlet/data-action-aio?obsno=0087940201"
    tar -xvf files.tar
    mv 0087940201/* .
    rmdir 0087940201/
    
    cd odf
    tar -xzvf 0087940201.tar.gz
    tar -xvf 0315_0087940201.TAR

The data so downloaded directly from ESAS contains a few different files.
Excluding the various tar/tar.gz files, the content changes from
`0087940201_esas/ODF/` to `0087940201_redl/odf/` are
(line numbers are wrong because I've removed some irrelevant changes)

Looks OK to me.  Let's try re-rerunning the basic processing chain.
I run my `esas_run` script on statler, modified to execute all of:

    cifbuild
    odfingest
    epchain withoutoftime=true
    epchain
    emchain

and no more.  Started running around 16:48pm.

    atran(sas)@statler:~/rsch/xmm$ nohup source esas_run > nohup_esas_run_0087940201_redl_chains_20151025.log &
    [1] 18126

NOW, try generating spectra from unadulterated event list (NO proton flare filtering!)
Started around 17:32p.

    atran(sas)@statler:~/rsch/xmm$ nohup source spectrum_debug_redl.tcsh > spectrum_debug_redl.log &
    [1] 24226

Inspect "redl" spectra: answer, yep, same problem present...

When I return to the ESAS processed spectra, it seems like the spectra
from both obsids show the same problem!

OK, this (above) also looks the same!...
AHA.  One big difference is background subtraction.
If I do use QPB background spectra in the 0551000201 data, then the high energy tail looks OK
(essentially, subtraction noise)
If I do NOT use QPB background spectra, high energy tail does that sharp uptick in the unfolded spectra.
In channels (x-axis), it looks like flat noise, so after convolving with
arf/rmf it looks like an uptick in signal at increasing energy.  GREAT.  This makes sense.

Casual thought: any correlation with this warning message I've been getting?

    ***Warning: Detected response matrix energy bin value = 0 (or neg).
	     XSPEC will instead use small finite value (response file will not be altered).

if the RMF is negative maybe it's throwing XSPEC for a loop...


Monday 2015 October 26
======================

Continuing pursuit of this mysterious high energy tail.

Trick to make unfolded spectra physically meaningful/useful: set model to unity
(zero-slope power-law with unity normalization) before plotting unfolded
spectrum.  Unfolded data are model dependent in XSPEC:

    D-unfolded = D * (unfolded model) / (folded model);

unfolded model = theoretical model integrated over plot bin, folded model =
model times response).

and I save the plots to `20151026_unfolded_mos1S001_obs*.png`, in lieu of
printing them out or embedding them here (a rich document might be nice for
this).

I'm currently speculating that this is either
1. odd instrument signal
2. soft proton contamination
In either case, whatever the signal is, is probably not being filtered by
effective area function.  It might produce a flat signal in detector space;
when the (vague, unspecified) response is divided out then we get a rising
signal due to the steep effective area drop-off at high energies.


Tuesday 2015 October 27
=======================

Finally sat down with XSPEC manual and worked out details of how "responses",
"models", "datagroups", "spectra" work.  And hallelujah, it all works out.

BUT, they show the conceptual idea works.

Wednesday 2015 October 28
=========================

Now that I'm starting to see an end in sight, and how this will be structured,
I'm going to pause and set up a proper research directory

... work on this deferred for a while I was properly tackling the ACA
constraint.


Friday 2015 November 13 -- Sunday 2015 November 15
==================================================

Brief list of available data:
* XMM pointings 2x
* Chandra ptgs of src (not much of remnant) (4554, 8929)
  Obsid 4554 does overlap the remnant, no grating.  Not likely to contribute much
  (short 15ks exposure, XMM-Newton effective area >> Chandra)
* MOST radio, 0.83GHz, resolution 43"
* ATCA 1.34GHz (gaensler paper) + simultaneous HI 1.420GHz. ~24" resolution 

Way behind, been tied up with ACA constraint stuff.

## Repo organization 

Finished a short Makefile tutorial (software carpentry) yesterday.

Attempted to set up Makefile for XMM data reduction.  Spent most of Friday on
this.  Although I vacillate between doing this and wanting to throw my hands
up and admit defeat, I'll stick to implementing a Makefile approach.
These problems (keeping files consistent in a pipeline, ensuring scientific
reproducibility) won't improve, if I don't tackle them head on.

Initialized git repo and pushed to Github to:
1. version control and branching
2. keep myself accountable and organized (ish).
3. ease of accessing / perusing revisions, distributing data / iPython
   notebooks, etc.

Comment: git push origin master, using https authentication, requires ssh -X on
my end.  Maybe change to using ssh instead of https for this?

## Reorganizing data

I discard some previous log files and data (mid-October nohup runs etc.).
None of the previous data I generated were directly related to research, but
mostly were due to my fumbling around with XMM SAS and ESAS, and re-running
various chains.  None of the iterations were for scientific exploration,
so no information is concealed by deleting the records for these script
re-runs.

Basically start with a clean slate.

    specbackgrp src  started 14:24 monday nov 16

May start using Git branches to organize ideas, and trace exploratory analyses.
Depends on the needs at hand.  Use git tag to annotate branch tips or
something, maybe.


Monday 2015 November 16
=======================

Continued organizing up workflow.  Started adding and running new scripts,
selected new regions.

## Scripting

Re-running specbackgrp script (spectrum extraction script). Script successfully
runs `mos_back` and `pn_back`, and renames some files.  But, then this appears
on my terminal:

    atran(sas)@statler:~/rsch/g309/xmm/0087940201/odf/repro$ specbackgrp src
    You should not see this! 

And, pressing enter creates more "You should not see this!" messages.
Cause: line breaks in commands being passed to grppha.
In addition, I need to escape exclamation points in tcsh for some reason...

Easiest solution: just use bash.  bash correctly inherits environment variables
($PATH) from calling tcsh, so that's OK.

## Region selection

NOTE: new "standard" procedure for region selection.
1. use PPS processed and merged image P0087940201EPX000OIMAGE8000.FTZ
2. use MOST radio contours for overlay to help see SNR location.

Created image of remnant with radio contours.
(missing: coordinates, scalebar, radio beam and x-ray PSF.  For now OK though.)

Loaded regions (see notes from Oct 18/19).  They were:

    # Source:
    circle(13:46:47.553, -62:51:02.52, 239.76")

    # Background:
    circle(13:47:42.885, -62:44:57.88, 125.41")
    circle(13:46:33.606, -62:42:02.47, 113.572")
    circle(13:47:32.693, -62:56:46.10, 125.41")

I made a few changes:
* moved one background circle that overlapped the SNR's radio contour
* change circle sizes to 120" (radius = 2 arcminutes), nice clean number
* move one background circle off a faint radio contour, that might trace some
  sort of gas / other emission not related to the remnant.
and the new background comprises six small circles around the remnant.

Saved image of:
* XMM 0087940201 merged PPS image, log scale, heat map
  (fits file is P0087940201EPX000OIMAGE8000.FTZ, and I symlink to this file)
* linear most contours (0.01, 0.02, 0.03, ..., 0.2 Jy/beam)
* src.reg, bkg.reg selections created today
to `20151116_xmm0087940201pps_mostlinear_src_bkg.png`.

And, added procedure for creating and regenerating MOST contours.  Pretty
straightforward.

## Minor coordinate mismatch

Adding new script to convert DS9 regions to XMM detector region expressions.
Using same source region as before with newly reprocessed data,
I'm getting VERY slightly different DETX/Y coordinates.
Here's an example for MOS1 detector.

    DS9 fk5: 
    0087940201: &&((DETX,DETY) IN circle(-2056.3, -1681.7, 4795.2))
    0551000201: &&((DETX,DETY) IN circle(-4649.7, -2786.9, 4795.2))()


    0087940201 (old): &&((DETX,DETY) IN circle(-2055.2, -1690.2, 4795.2))
    0551000201 (old): &&((DETX,DETY) IN circle(-4650.2, -2784.3, 4795.2))

The difference is ~1-2 detector units, i.e. ~0.1 arcsec, except for DETY
in 0087940201 MOS1 (~9 detector units is ~0.45 arcsec).
These differences are minute given the large region size (~8 arcmin diam),
XMM-Newton PSF, etc.

Working hypothesis: data from XMM SOC archive differs slightly from data
available via NASA HEASARC w3browse.  I test this by getting w3browse data for
these obsids to compare event lists again (rerun cifbuild, odfingest, emchain).

Result (working in `/data/mpofls/atran/research/g309/xmm`):

OK.  So, my script returns the same result as claimed.
* For 0551000201, w3browse data match XMM-SAS data; no difference.
* For 0087940201, w3browse data still disagree.  But, strangely, it disagrees
  slightly with the data from the first time I computed these regions (by 0.4
  in detx and 0.7 in dety).  Both sets of w3browse data disagree more
  substantially w/ the XMM-SAS downloaded data (~1 in detx and ~8 in dety).

This is curious, and my bet is that it's related to updated calibration files
being passed between XMM SOC and NASA HEASARC.  But, for our analysis, the
discrepancy is extremely unimportant, so don't pursue this further.

## New regions for XMM detectors produced

Quick comparison of source regions being produced (because the source circle is
unchanged from mid-October):

    Old, 0087940201:
	&&((DETX,DETY) IN circle(-2055.2, -1690.2, 4795.2))
	&&((DETX,DETY) IN circle(1509.3, -2280.0, 4795.2))
	&&((DETX,DETY) IN circle(-1383.0, 2121.9, 4795.2))
    New, 0087940201:
	&&((DETX,DETY) IN circle(-2056.3, -1681.7, 4795.2))
	&&((DETX,DETY) IN circle(1500.8, -2281.1, 4795.2))
	&&((DETX,DETY) IN circle(-1374.4, 2123.1, 4795.2))
    Old, 0551000201:
	&&((DETX,DETY) IN circle(-4650.2, -2784.3, 4795.2))
	&&((DETX,DETY) IN circle(2590.2, -4880.6, 4795.2))
	&&((DETX,DETY) IN circle(-2486.9, 4712.8, 4795.2))
    New, 0551000201:
	&&((DETX,DETY) IN circle(-4649.7, -2786.9, 4795.2))
	&&((DETX,DETY) IN circle(2592.7, -4880.1, 4795.2))
	&&((DETX,DETY) IN circle(-2489.4, 4712.3, 4795.2))

All show some very slight changes, order of <10 detector units (which is <0.5
arcsec, so OK).  Changes look smaller for old vs. new 0551000201, maybe because
it is a more recent obsid?  I'm not sure.

Anyways, I'm ok with this, so I will overwrite the old region files.
If needed, they can be salvaged from my old notes anyways.

Remark: to make Makefile work, perhaps the right approach is to build modular
scripts that help hide hard-to-manipulate filename patterns.
Low priority, but can revisit this later...

## Walkthrough of data:

TODO: walk-through data carefully, documenting all possible changes/etc.

0551000201: inspect soft X-ray images
* MOS1 CCD4 appears to have an oddly bright edge, in the file
    0551000201/odf/repro$ ds9 mos1S001-obj-image-det-soft.fits
  I'm not sure if this is removed in the cleaned event list.
  Other CCDs look ok.
* MOS2 CCD5 is very obviously in anomolous state, matching the mos-filter
  flagging.  Other CCDs look ok.
* PN image, presumably without OOT events, looks good.

0087940201:
* MOS1 looks ok (obj-image-det-soft.fits)
* MOS2 looks ok (obj-image-det-soft.fits)
* PN (obj-image-det.fits), presumably without OOT events, looks good.

I re-run spectrum extraction for all the data now, with new background regions.
After some wrestling with the precise nohup command...

## Looking at pn-spectra results

pn-spectra failed on 0551000201 because pnS003-clean.fits has unexpected
SUBMODE keyword 'PrimeLargeWindow', but pn-spectra only accepts
* 'PrimeFullWindowExtended' (the PN mode for 0087940201)
  (it also checks for frame time FRMTIME, and treats files w/ FRMTIME <210
   or >210 differently)
* 'PrimeFullWindow'
and it can't handle anything else.  I don't really understand why.

Weird issue: grppha log shows errors reading "infile" for `mos1S001_bkg`,
for BOTH 0551000201 and 0087940201.  Why?
Issue does not occur for either `mos1S001_src` or `mos2S002_bkg`, so this is
quite unusual.

Another issue: I should have grouped the "-os.pi" spectra.  Added a thing into
my scripts to do so, and ran the grppha command by hand for 0087940201 (no
point in doing this for 0551000201).

I do not think it's worth my time to try to reproduce what pn-spectra is doing
from scratch.  If I can't use the ESAS QPB, maybe I can sacrifice some low
energy counts (where soft proton spectrum seems to curve) and just model the
soft proton contamination outright in the PN background.

## More XSPEC fitting discussion

Chatted more with Josh about XSPEC today -- see notebook for some remarks.
Tools Josh noted: Sherpa has a nice Python interface; J. Buchner has created a
package BXA for Bayesian sampling to drive model fits of X-ray spectra, through
XSPEC or Sherpa.

I think I now get what's up with these identifiers.
It's easiest for me to think about folding models through RMF/ARF files.

The functions for response/arf are the most critical, even though in the
default (simplest case) they're normally hidden from the user.
RMF and ARF files, with identifier "x:y", map model/source x --> spectrum y.
In XSPEC, this makes the __spectrum__ "show up" for the given __model__.

    Model params
        params for spectrum x
        params for spectrum y
        ...

Main point of confusion: if two models fold through different RMFs to produce
an output signal, counts(channel), how does XSPEC fit two models, folded
through distinct RMFs, to data that was ALREADY passed through an RMF to
convert channels --> energy ? (when using setplot en).  We must have assumed an
RMF to get to energy, but different counts are parameterized by different RMFs
in our mode.

Changing rmf/arf has no apparent effect on data, in either energy or channel
space (but obviously affects model).
But, removing rmf entirely kills our ability to move to energy space.
Hypothesis: XSPEC makes some assumption on the RMF to show it in energy space,
say, making it diagonal.
I'm not sure how they send the model to energy -- I would assume that 
it's folded through rmf/arf, then passed through the assumed RMF (undoing the
RMF step), something like

    M(I) = integral[ M(E) * rmf(I,E) * arf(E) dE ]
    M'(E) = rmf^{-1}(I,E) * M(I)

Apparent answer: XSPEC is fitting in channel space.  See
    http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/manual/XspecSpectralFitting.html
for the chi^2 formula being minimized -- specified strictly in channel space.
This seems completely logical.

Another thing: remember, BACKSCAL does account for ARF in calculation.
I would think the spatial variation of the RMF matters too, but I guess that's
probably much smaller.

For PRACTICE: walk through ALL XSPEC commands used to get spectra.
rmfgen, arfgen, detmap, etc.

Saturday -- Sunday 2015 November 21-22
======================================

Current list of procedure changes (not yet executed):
1. remove enhanced signal in MOS #1, CCD #4.
   script mos-spectra takes cflim parameter to specify where to cut, manually
2. fix PN spectrum extraction for 0551000201
3. explore effects of changing a few epchain parameters
4. explore effect of removing point sources w/ automated algorithm


First attempt to fit backgrounds from 3 instruments simultaneously.
Looks pretty good, I'd say.
* Background regions from 0087940201 only
* 1.49, 1.75 keV line intensities same for both MOS1/MOS2
  (woops, forgot to freeze)
* 1.49, 7.49, 7.11, 8.05, 8.62, 8.90 keV for PN
* Soft proton power law ~ 0.5 for MOS1/MOS2, ~0.76 for PN
* X-ray background - allow a constant term for MOS1/MOS2/PN
  but otherwise use same model
  unabsorbed 1 keV apec, phabs x (power + apec) with 1.4 power law, 0.3 keV
  apec; nH = 1 x 10^22.

Monday 2015 November 23
=======================

Current list of procedure changes (not yet executed, copied from Sat/Sun 2015
Nov 21-22):
1. remove enhanced signal in MOS #1, CCD #4.
   script mos-spectra takes cflim parameter to specify where to cut, manually
2. fix PN spectrum extraction for 0551000201
3. explore effects of changing a few epchain parameters
4. explore effect of removing point sources w/ automated algorithm

Early morning of Monday (~1:30am) I was trying to apply the "good" background
fit to the SNR fit.

__Observation:__ the instrumental line fit from background regions is
over-eager -- we actually have negative residual.  Modeled PN lines shoot way
above the actual signal when I import the background parameters unchanged from
my fit to bkg region (back.xcm).

__Simple mistake:__ I did not account for ratio of src/bkg areas (normally
automatically done by XSPEC, by taking BACKSCAL ratio and applying to the
BACKGRND spectrum).

QUESTION: Is taking ratio of areas OK (well, integral arf(x,y) dxdy)?
Tentatively, yes.  Difference in RMF/ARF is accounted for by folding through
SOURCE RMF/ARF instead of BKG RMF/ARF.

QUESTION: ARF/RMF account for extended sources by weighting over the source
region.  Are they always "normalized" to 1, so that I should be multiplying my
background model normalizations by the ratio BACKSCAL(src)/BACKSCAL(bkg)??
As ESAS is intended to work with XSPEC, I'm going to assume this is OK.

QUESTION: what about energy dependence of ARF/RMF?
This should be fine.  Again as long as source/bkg arf/rmf are weighted
correctly to handle this, that's OK.  All we have to do is pass model
parameters through the arf/rmf.
Now, of course, XMM-SAS's backend implementation is WAY easier if we can assume
that arf (or, rmf) is separable as arf(x,y,E) = phi(x,y) * psi(E).  That is,
the spectral response/gain of the detector is spatially invariant.
But that's a question for another day...

__Adapting background fit parameters to source fit__:

I created a one-off script (`xmm/bkg2src_norm`) that gives me the ratio of
src/bkg areas for each instrument in obsid 0087940201, by simply inspecting
BACKSCAL keywords inserted by `mos-spectra`.

    atran(sas)@treble:~/rsch/g309/xmm$ ./bkg2src_norm

    MOS1 BACKSCAL calculation
    src: 7.098143E+07
    bkg: 8.421573E+07
    (7.098143E+07) / (8.421573E+07)
    src/bkg: 0.842852398239616

    MOS2 BACKSCAL calculation
    src: 6.927987E+07
    bkg: 1.012479E+08
    (6.927987E+07) / (1.012479E+08)
    src/bkg: 0.684259821685191

    PN BACKSCAL calculation
    src: 6.433184E+07
    bkg: 9.177010E+07
    (6.433184E+07) / (9.177010E+07)
    src/bkg: 0.701010895705682

Now, I need to apply the normalization to my background fits.  Unfortunately
this is non-trivial because neither bash nor xspec can do math (every day I am
inching closer to PyXSPEC or Sherpa or something better than this).
Simple fix conceptually, even if a hassle to implement (TBD).

NOW, are there any background regions we need to twiddle?
Comparing line emission from source and background... yes, more adjustments
needed.  Intensities, and ratios of lines, are definitely not the same.

* XRB -- I will assume constant over detector region

* Instrumental lines vary.

  Across MOS1/MOS2 the spatial distribution of line strengths is similar.
  BUT, rotation of detectors + different regions means there is no reason to
  expect the normalizations, in either absolute intensity or ratio of
  intensities, to be linked.  All we can say is that absolute intensities
  should be comparable and should follow the map of line emission from Kuntz
  and Snowden (2008).

  TODO: can we use the database of FWC observations to estimate the line
  strength and/or ratio of line strengths?

  TODO: what is the physical mechanism that causes the fluorescent emission, in both
  FWC and non-FWC observations?

  TODO: why does ESAS doc consistently assert that Si line is at 1.75 keV?
  They're probably right, but I want to know what line this is that is
  different than the normal 1.85 heavily ionized Si line.
  Probably, similar line but energy adjusted due to presence of remaining
  electrons or something...

  IF the photons/particles that induce fluorescent emission are predominantly 
  NOT focused down the telescope boresight, then it should be easy to
  characterize lines regardless of sky position (barring obscenely bright
  things like Cyg X-1 or whatever).

* Misc. point sources -- need to test out cheese

* Soft proton, I have no fucking idea. ESAS creates soft proton images based on
  the spectral fit -- I don't know if this lets us consider spatial variation,
  or if it's just based on a semi-random event list cut based on our model soft
  proton spectrum (if so we'd HAVE to either get a global fit, or specify the
  extraction region -- only a global fit makes sense, and that might not be
  possible for all observations).

  TODO: physical mechanism for soft proton contamination.  Any spatial
  dependence?!

* SWCX (solar wind charge exchange) -- ok, this ought to be invariant.
  But inspect the data.  Be suspicious of oxygen abundance from vnei fitting.


## Adjusting toy SNR fit (0087940201)

allowing various components in vnei model to float, I can get down to
chi-squared = 1022.  Keeps going to 0 neon, and 0 iron.  Numbers are wonky
(some places asking for 20,40x solar for Ar/Ca/O/Ne or w/e).

Freeing oxygen helps handle low-energy excess (would be hard to distinguish
from SWCX usually, but if we assume SWCX + XRB from background regions is
representative, then this is OK).

I'm tempted to let SWCX float for PN, but that's no good because our estimate
of SWCX is inferred from a fit to real data

Add two more lines to SWCX.  I think the residual in soft PN/MOS emission is
part of what's getting us, and it's not well modeled by either O or Fe emission
in the SNR vnei.

## NASA XMM-GOF tool to estimate SWCX

Looking at trend plot for revolution 0315, obsid 0087940201:

    https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xmm/scripts/xmm_trend.html

Start,stop for 0087940201 are 1.15354e8 and 1.15394e8 seconds
Note: these are seconds measured from January 01, 1998, 00:00:00 UTC
The calculation

    January 01 1998 00:00:00utc + 1.15354430246723e8 seconds

yields 2001 August 28, 02:53:50am UTC, which is just one minute off from the
stated observation start time (02:52:50, I don't know what happened).

It looks like our observation is fine with basic flare filtering (matches my
experience so far), but shows evidence for SWCX contamination.  I don't know
how much, from the plot, but certainly above baseline.

Taking the epoch (01/01/98) and adding 1.15354
It aligns to the observation start time...

## OK I need to stop, step backward, and retrace a few details of my work so far.


Tuesday 2015 November 24
========================

Current list of pending procedure changes (copied from Mon 2015 Nov 23):
1. remove enhanced signal in MOS #1, CCD #4.
   script mos-spectra takes cflim parameter to specify where to cut, manually
2. fix PN spectrum extraction for 0551000201
3. explore effects of changing a few epchain parameters
4. explore effect of removing point sources w/ automated algorithm

Spoke with Pat.  OK to go ahead with procedures I'm considering:
1. estimating line strengths and ratios based on FWC spectra
2. applying data cut to estimate SWCX contamination between start and end of observation!
3. didn't ask explicitly, but maybe use ESAS proton task to back out a model
   spectrum in central region... assuming the soft proton vignetting function
   IS included in ESAS, as claimed by snowden's presentation

   http://web.mit.edu/iachec/meetings/2014/Presentations/Kuntz.pdf

Stuff from Pat:
1. just do a simple background subtraction, compare your results
2. good to have numbers.  preliminary, but use for comparisons and to guide
   direction of work
3. temperature kT ~ 2 keV is really high! check your methods
4. proton vignetting, interesting..
5. ay253 sounds worthwhile.
6. yeah, no reason not to expect spectral variation with position on detector
   (proton reflectivity on mirrors varies with energy too, right?)
   so it does make sense that soft proton power law should vary.
   tricky problem to deal with, but oh well.


Wednesday 2015 November 25
==========================

Playing with fakeit and vnei, to help intuit effect of changing elemental
abundances, kT, and tau.  No notable results produced.

Paused to work more on ACA stuff, after MP meeting.


Wednesday-Thursday 2015 December 2,3
====================================

Resumed after Thanksgiving + a few more MP script things over Mon/Tues/Weds.

Current list of pending procedure changes (copied from Mon 2015 Nov 23):
2. fix PN spectrum extraction for 0551000201
3. explore effects of changing a few epchain parameters
4. explore effect of removing point sources w/ automated algorithm
5. check what/where filter flags are applied, and add comments to scripts.
   (flag and pattern rejections)
   see if we need to evselect anywhere to remove these bad events.
6. double check plots of histogram filtering, see if 2nd round is needed.
7. add mosaicking step.

MOS1 CCD4 noise band removal
----------------------------
Per 2015 November 16 notes, where I inspected soft X-ray images produced by a
"standard chain", remove MOS1 CCD4 edge noise in 0551000201 as follows:

Generate DETX histogram using xmmselect on mos1S001-ori.fits (emchain
output) with selection `(CCDNR == 4)&&(PI in [100:1300])`,
histogram binning 10, and histogram min/max of 0,13200.

    Histogram: img-notes/20151202_histogram.png

The noise doesn't appear too enhanced, peaks around 26 counts and is
fairly narrow, compared to the ESAS example.  But it is clearly a strong
feature.  From visual inspection, we can cut events with DETX >= 12000.

I double check with 0551000201/odf/repro/mos1S001-obj-image-det-soft.fits
and confirm, by eye, that a cut at DETX = 12000 looks good.
Note that to help visually pull out the feature, you need to smooth or bin
the data in ds9.

Modified script `specbackgrp_0551000201` to use cflim=12000 for MOS1 spectrum
processing.  I did not generate new spectra immediately.
Quick visual inspection of current regions in MOS1S001 sky coords suggests that
none are near the chip edges, so we should be ok.

Get PN spectrum extraction working for 0551000201
-------------------------------------------------
See 2015 Nov. 20 notes. I need to inspect how pn-spectra works.

    Depending on SUBMODE and FRMTIME, set values for
        $scale
            $scale is used in two places:
            1. compute $rate based on NAXIS2 keyword in corner OOT events?!
               PI in 600:1300, 1650:7200 (both hard and soft)
               * $rate in turn is used printed with "Corner rate/corner hardness"
                 as part of pn-spectra terminal output.
            2. compute $hard based on NAXIS2 keyword in corner OOT events
               PI in 1650:7200 (hard only)
            PrimeFullWindowExtended (frametime < 210)
            uses scale 0.0232 (2.32%?)
            PrimeFullWindowExtended (frametime > 210)
            uses scale 0.0163 (1.63% sensible, larger frametime -> less OOT)
            PrimeFullWindow
            uses scale 0.063 (6.3%?).  Again about right, almost 3x faster
            readout means 3x more OOT events.

            Neither $rate nor $hard have any effect on final output.
        $submode (split on PrimeFullWindowExtended, depending on frame time)
            Doesn't seem to be used anywhere, except in printing output.
        $mode
            Again isn't used anywhere except in diagnostic output

    Look into how OOT event %s are computed.
    Based on SPIE paper on PN operations (1997?).
    PN operations:
        NL (regular shift+read) = 23.04 microsec
        FS (fast shift) = 0.72 microsec

    Full frame:
        readout time ~ 23.04*200 microsec = 4.608 ms
        integration time ~ 73.4 ms
        % OOT = 6.28%

    Ext full frame:
        readout time ~ 4.608 ms (same as full frame)
        integration time ~ 199.1 ms (accomplished by adding 52.4ms delay
        between quadrant readout -- not sure how, diff between 199.1ms and
        73.4ms is 31.425*4 ms)
        % OOT = 2.31%

    Large window: only use 1/2 CCD.
        rapidly read and discard lines 0-99 ~ 0.72 * 100 microsec
        read remaining lines (100-199) normally ~ 23.04 * 100 microsec
        read/dump 100 lines, fast ~ 0.72 * 100 microsec
            (this discards OOTs from preceding readout; fast shift still has OOTs but much fewer)
        integration time ~ 47.7ms
        % OOT = 0.072/(47.7ms * 0.949) = 0.159%

        total time: 2.448ms * 11 + twait,twarm,etc
        not sure how they got 47.7ms integration time, but I guess it works
        out.  The OOT% I'm getting is consistent with XMM user's guide.

Note, OOT events are NOT incorporated anywhere until the final spectra are
extracted (and this is done in `pn_back`).  In `pn-filter` the regular and OOT
files are processed separately.  The log from `pn_back` notes the observation
mode and OOT scaling to use.

After further reading, I realized that large window observations can't be
processed by ESAS because there are no corner observation data
available.  Thus we can't get a QPB.  This was all stated in the ESAS cookbook
up front.  OK, that makes sense.

At some point (Dec. 3), I attempted to run a modified version of pn-spectra.
This obviously failed; even after setting the scale parameter for large window,
it couldn't extract corner count rates and hit a divide-by-zero error when
calculating a hardness ratio.

So how do we deal with this dataset specially?

What if we just fit the background without QPB?

Fit 0087940201 MOS1S001 background spectrum, using `back.xcm` and then invoking
`data 2 none` in XSPEC to discard the MOS2S002 and PNS003 spectra.

    -> chisqr changes marginally (1.0846 to 1.1164)

Inspect residuals from model fit, then background remove (so compare to data
w/o QPB to model w/QPB).  By eye, maybe MOS could get away with it.  But, PN
has a huge excess in soft band (<0.5 keV).

Fit 0087940201, all 3 instruments, background spectrum, using `back.xcm` then
invoking back 1 none, back 2 none, back 3 none to discard QPBs.

Maybe we can find an alternate way to work around this...


Friday 2015 December 4
======================

0087940201 pnS003 exposure QPB from ESAS -- looks good, compared in XSPEC and
the QDP plot from `pn_back`.

But, 0551000201 QPBs for both MOS1 and MOS2 look like utter crap.
They look ok in the QDP plot file, but in XSPEC they look really bad.  What
happened??

I looked through logs for MOS1S001 src with mos_back and didn't see any obvious
issues.


Monday 2015 December 7 -- epreject exploration
==============================================

Current list of pending procedure changes (copied from Weds 2015 Dec 2):
2. fix PN spectrum extraction for 0551000201
    -- in works, deciding how to work without QPB, we'd need different
    procedure.  Defer temporarily, I will work out a few more things on
    0087940201 first.

    Remark: epchain doc claims that its runbackground=Y mode is able to create
    background spectrum for LW imaging mode.  But, looking at XMM-Newton sky
    FOV in DS9, this seems impossible...

3. explore effects of changing a few epchain parameters
    epreject, epnoise
4. explore effect of removing point sources w/ automated algorithm
5. check what/where filter flags are applied, and add comments to scripts.
   (flag and pattern rejections)
   see if we need to evselect anywhere to remove these bad events.
6. double check plots of histogram filtering, see if 2nd round is needed.
7. add mosaicking step.
8. is it necessary to run filtering step 2x?
   re-run espfilt, see what happens.

Investigating effect of epchain run: epreject, epnoise
------------------------------------------------------

* epreject -- only a small number of pixels should be affected by the high
  energy strikes.  (why is it disabled by default?)
* epnoise -- seems unnecessary, procedure is just to remove frames with too
  many soft x-ray counts.  This should be covered by pn-filter task.
  I will skip this.

Parameter settings via epchain to epreject.  epchain's call to epreject does
NOT screen soft flares by default in xmmsas_20141104.  This is OK to me.

    withsoftflarescreening=N hardcoded in epchain
    withoffsetmap=Y by default in epchain, but not in SAS doc...
    withnoisehandling='N' by default, user cannot set through epchain
        (I don't even know what it does)
    sigma=4 for offset correction (default)
    noiseparameters=... (default)
    withxrlcorrection=N (default, imaging mode so no need)

I set sigma=5 for finding bright spots, per recommendation of epreject doc:

    Tests indicate that setting this parameter to $\sim4\,\sigma$ is a good choice
    for short ( $\sim5\mbox{ ks}$) exposures; for longer exposures this parameter
    can be increased (to $\sim5$-$6\,\sigma$ for more than 20 ks).

And I use adu=20 and adu<20 (PHA column in FITS files) to look at actual data.

    It is recommended to control the results by accumulating an image below
    20 adu after this task: this image shows the pixels where an offset shift
    was applied (Fig.5). 

Running epchain with runepreject=Y for 0087940201 PNS003, but epreject failed
for both OOT and regular runs.

    ** epreject: warning (NoOffsetMap), No offset map found; using 20 ADU image
    instead
    [...]
    ** epreject: warning (notCalibrated),  no offset calibration for submode
    PrimeFullWindowExtended, skipping rest of the task

No offset map is available, OK, where should that be found?  epreject calls the
function:

    OAL_hasAssociatedSet(OFFSET_DATA)  looking in ODF (ODF access layer)

Which, I assume (but did not verify), seeks the following files according to
online ODF guide:

    files of form {RRRR}_{obsidentif}_PN{U}{EEE}{CC}ODI.FIT
        {U} = observation scheduled (S) or unscheduled (U), I don't know what that means
        {EEE} = exposure number within observation
        {CC} = PN CCD
    correspond to EPIC PN offset data.

0087940201 has no such offset files, so I guess offset maps were not computed
early in the mission.
But, 0551000201 has these offset files!

Now, what about the offset calibration map?
From SAS source (packages/cal/f90/cal.f90) it looks like pnMedianMap
access interface was only added in November 2003.

    epreject attempts to read pnMedianMap from CCF.

        call CAL_pnMedianMap(r4med)

    In the source for CAL library ( packages/cal/f90/CalF90cxxGlue.cc ),
    inspect function CAL_pnMedianMap.  CalServer is used to instantiate a
    LowEnergyNoiseServer, which has method medianMap to read in the medianMap
    for a given mode and CCD.

    LowEnergyNoiseServer appears to read this in by creating

        CcfConstituentTable ccftab(dataSet, "MEDIAN_MAP_INDEX");
        const Table * medianMapTab = ccftab.block();

    And I can't easily figure out where the code for CcfConstituentTable comes
    from

        epreject:- reading from CCF: pnMedianMap
        epreject:- Opening CCF CIF /data/mpofls/atran/research/g309/xmm/0087940201/odf/repro/ccf.cif

        [....
        many calls of form:]

        epreject:- Attempting to access block with name 'MEDIAN_MAP_DUMMY' in dataset with name '/proj/xmm/ccf/EPN_REJECT_0006.CCF'.

        [so I'm not sure what the role of the CCF file is, in all this.
         Actually, why should anything be in the CIF file if this is a standard
         reference offset image for all observations?]

OK, I'm not going further than this.  Don't want to spend another hour or two
wading through source + logging output to figure it out.

(edit: I guess I changed my mind...)

0087940201 won't have epreject run; the offset map is not available in the ODF,
and the reference offset map (count images from many observations) was not
found in the CIF.  I don't know what file is missing, and I don't know why it's
missing.

BUT, 0551000201 does have offset map available; I run this accordingly.

    Histogram binning on PHA is indeed slightly different, fewer events at
    lower energy.  Consistent with epchain log which claims that many events
    were offset corrected, but I don't see any events below 20 ADU in evselect

I'm really confused.  Keywords in `EXPOS{ccd#}` tables of pnS003-ori.fits
indicate offset maps changed, but there are no ADU<20 events in EVENTS table.

events01.dat ->cleanevents01.dat filters on PI > 150, AFTER epreject step.
We normally expect ADU=20 to correspond to 100 eV, so I'm surprised that any
events with ADU=20 exist at all.  I guess these are events with different
offsets, such that ADU=20 corresponds to PI > 150.

This seems like a plausible explanation.  So, how can I look at the energy
shift?  I'm worried that so many events were affected by this procedure
(depends on the chip), so we DO need to inspect the result of the filtering.

Try running epchain with parameter screenlowthresh=0.  Tested, still observe no
ADU < 20 events.  Try again keeping intermediate products..

    epchain runepreject=Y sigma=5 screenlowthresh=0 keepintermediate=all >& epchain_rerun_nocut_interm.log
    evselect table=P0551000201PNS003PIEVLI0000.FIT expression='(PHA<20)' filteredset=pnS003-ori-rerun_nocut_lt20adu.fits

Inspect rawevents01.dat.  From the epchain logging output:

        epreject:-    576802 of  1008425 events selected for offset correction
        epreject:-    101285 events shifted below threshold of    20 [adu]

    evselect table=rawevents01.dat expression='(PHA<20)' filteredset=rawevents01_lt20adu.fits

        evselect:- selected 101285 rows from the input table.

    evselect table=events01.dat expression='(PHA<20)' filteredset=events01_lt20adu.fits

        evselect:- selected 101285 rows from the input table.

    evselect table=cleanevents01.dat expression='(PHA<20)' filteredset=cleanevents01_lt20adu.fits

        evselect:- selected 0 rows from the input table.

BINGO.  
Aside: after epevents call (converts rawevents01.dat to events01.dat),
epchain calls attcalc on events01.dat; this just adds X/Y columns to FITS event
list and has no effect on ADU<20 events.

Let's deconstruct the culprit evselect call in epchain, which is:

    evselect table=events01.dat:EVENTS withfilteredset=Y \
        filteredset=cleanevents01.dat
        destruct=Y
        expression='(PI>0 && RAWY>0 )' \
        writedss=Y
        updateexposure=Y
        keepfilteroutput=Y
        -w 10

Why is this destroying the ADU<20 events?

    Many of these have FLAG field 134217728 = 0x07FF FDAE
        0000 0111 1111 1111 ... 1111 1101 1010 1110
    I see one example of 134217732 = 0x08000004
        0x4 -> close to CCD window
        0x0800,0000 -> no idea... not listed in pn flag attributes...
    But evselect call is not filtering on FLAG.

    Flag: -w 10 forces only first 10 of each warning type to be shown.
    Flags: filteredset, keepfilteroutput --> set output as usual
    Flag: writedss=Y is normally on by default
    Flag: updateexposure=Y writes new keywords (LIVETIME, ONTIME, etc)
    Flag: withfilteredset=Y this is NO LONGER in the SAS documentation...

AH, PI value = NULL for these events.
    (creating a histogram on PI value in 'fv' causes fv to segfault and die)


The raw events list (after epreject, before epevents) has PHA w/offset applied,
FLAG, OFF_COR; no PI value is assigned.

Inspecting the ADU<20 events in DS9, I note
* spread due to epframes randomizing position of events within pixel
  (if you count blocks, comes out about right, nearly 64 pixels)
* a lot more events than I would expect.  Could be associated with 
  flaring in this observation?!...
  (do we need to run soft flare filtering first?)

After epevents is run, events list has added:
    DETX, DETY, PHA_CTI, PI, PATTERN, 

OK, try running process without epreject, as:

    epchain screenlowthresh=0 keepintermediate=all >& epchain_rerun.log

    evselect table=rawevents01.dat expression='(PHA==20)' filteredset=rawevents01_eq20adu.fits
        evselect:- selected 228915 rows from the input table.
    evselect table=events01.dat expression='(PHA==20)' filteredset=events01_eq20adu.fits
        evselect:- selected 228915 rows from the input table.
    evselect table=cleanevents01.dat expression='(PHA==20)' filteredset=cleanevents01_eq20adu.fits
        evselect:- selected 220002 rows from the input table.

    evselect table=P0551000201PNS003PIEVLI0000.FIT expression='(PHA==20)' filteredset=P0551000201PNS003PIEVLI0000.FIT_eq20adu.fits
        evselect:- selected 3577095 rows from the input table.

That is a LOT of events at ADU=20.  Inspecting the uncleaned events file:
    ds9 events01_eq20adu.fits
I see basically what looks like signal, no obvious cosmic ray strikes (or, hard
to differentiate from point sources in FOV).

I'm strongly leaning towards ignoring this shift.
The correction is order of a few ADU ~ 10-15 eV = 0.010-0.015 keV
This should be pretty negligible, I think -- especially since it's just
isolated to a few pixels, and is thus a ~1% effect.

We have much bigger fish to fry.
    

    
Tuesday 2015 December 8 -- more on epreject
===========================================

Current list of pending procedure changes (copied from Mon 2015 Dec 7):
2. fix PN spectrum extraction for 0551000201
    -- in works, deciding how to work without QPB, we'd need different
    procedure.  Defer temporarily, I will work out a few more things on
    0087940201 first.

    Remark: epchain doc claims that its runbackground=Y mode is able to create
    background spectrum for LW imaging mode.  But, looking at XMM-Newton sky
    FOV in DS9, this seems impossible...

3. explore effects of changing a few epchain parameters
    epreject, epnoise
    (epreject -- changing sigma?)
    (epnoise -- ??)
4. explore effect of removing point sources w/ automated algorithm
5. check what/where filter flags are applied, and add comments to scripts.
   (flag and pattern rejections)
   see if we need to evselect anywhere to remove these bad events.
6. double check plots of histogram filtering, see if 2nd round is needed.
7. add mosaicking step.
8. is it necessary to run filtering step 2x?
   re-run espfilt, see what happens.


0087940201: no offset maps to use with epreject
0551000201: epreject run, I can't tell whether good or not.  The number of
events down-shifted at 5 sigma is surprisingly large.  And the map of adu=20
events seems to cover the entire CCD.

I compare the histograms from running epchain with and without epreject (in
both cases, without filtering events < 0.150 keV).

Use fv to generate two histograms of PHA, bin size 4 (channel range 0-4095),
and export to plaintext as CSV.  Manually edit file to remove quotation marks;
in Vim, `:%s/"//g` will do.

    cd ${XMM_PATH}/xmm/0551000201/odf/repro_epreject/
    epchain runepreject=Y sigma=5 screenlowthresh=0 keepintermediate=all
    fv P0551000201PNS003PIEVLI0000.FIT
    cd ../../repro
    epchain screenlowthresh=0 keepintermediate=all
    fv P0551000201PNS003PIEVLI0000.FIT

Inspected further by generating histograms from FITS files in Python.

Diverted for part of afternoon to clean up some public doc on flags + epreject,
XMM data reduction.  Maybe this will clarify things.

    ocf.io/atran/useful_xmm.html

Try looking in a specific energy (PI) band vs. just PHA-selected image, per
SAS User Guide 4.3.2.1.1 example.  Note that PHA>=20 should not have any
effect.

    # in odf/repro_epreject/
    evselect table=P0551000201PNS003PIEVLI0000.FIT \
            filteredset=P0551000201PNS003PIEVLI0000_PI_120_200.fits \
            expression='(PHA>=20)&&(PI>=120)&&(PI<200)'
        evselect:- selected 968705 rows from the input table.
    # in odf/repro/
    evselect table=P0551000201PNS003PIEVLI0000.FIT \
            filteredset=P0551000201PNS003PIEVLI0000_PI_120_200.fits \
            expression='(PHA>=20)&&(PI>=120)&&(PI<200)'
        evselect:- selected 1013560 rows from the input table.

This is actually great -- the noise reduction pops out to the eyes,
I've saved the image to `img-notes/20151208_epreject_0551000201_soft.png`.

One mistake, my Python histograms were generated with OOT file vs. regular event
files, no wonder... massive difference mostly accounted for by discrepancy at
lowest energies, interestingly.

After epchain, run with epreject ends up throwing away ~2 million rows
I don't know how many of those rows are really good, though. I'll re-run things
and find out.

I throw out ALL the processed data for 0551000201, and start over again.
Accidentally threw out CIF file and ODF summary.
Re-building now, then going to set up chainfilter runs at home.

    atran(sas)@cooper:~/rsch/g309/xmm$ nohup /bin/tcsh -c \
        'source sasinit 0551000201; chainfilter_0551000201;' \
        >& 20151208_nohup_chainfilter_0551000201.log &
    [1] 30394

Next call is:

    atran(sas)@cooper:~/rsch/g309/xmm$ nohup /bin/tcsh -c \
        'source sasinit 0551000201; chainfilter_0551000201_no-epreject;' \

    [1] 25946


Wednesday 2015 December 9 -- epreject results
=============================================

## epreject results and diffing

Compared and subtracted very soft X-ray images to see results of epreject.

    farith '0551000201/odf/repro_no-epreject/pnS003-ori_vsoft-img.fits' \
        '0551000201/odf/repro/pnS003-ori_vsoft-img.fits' 'asdf.fits' SUB

Printed and annotated image (hints: use diverging color map `h5_dkbluered`and
set symmetric limits about the Gaussian-ish distribution centered on 0).

I observe a fair amount of noise subtraction (positive delta, red spots),
especially on "left" CCDs (2, 3, 11, 12).  There is one REALLY bright spot on
CCD 10, where epreject results in net addition of +200 counts.
On some modified columns, a lot of shifting (alternating add/substract) 
(look like they could be readout streaks, but are not)

Yes, epreject removes some noise in very soft images (0.12 to 0.20 keV), when
comparing the two images side-by-side.  So that looks promising.

Now, I also compare 0.5-2 keV images and do a subtraction.

    # Run 1x in each directory, repro/ and repro_no-epreject/
    evselect table=pnS003-ori.fits filteredset=pnS003-ori_0.5_to_2_kev.fits expression='(PI>=500)&&(PI<2000)' -V 0
    evselect table='pnS003-ori_0.5_to_2_kev.fits' withimageset=true \
        imageset='pnS003-ori_0.5_to_2_kev_img.fits' xcolumn=DETX ycolumn=DETY \
        imagebinning=binSize ximagebinsize=50 yimagebinsize=50

    farith \
        '0551000201/odf/repro_no-epreject/pnS003-ori_0.5_to_2_kev_img.fits' \
        '0551000201/odf/repro/pnS003-ori_0.5_to_2_kev_img.fits' \
        'epreject_diff_0.5_to_2_kev_img.fits' SUB

The characteristics are completely different.  Here, image is almost all faint
noise (within +/- 15).
* At bright star HD119682, there is a smattering of signal in subtracted image;
  when smoothed, there is bipolar structure to the delta counts (+/- 12 ish).
  I don't know why.  Likely not physical because it is confined to the center
  of the star, and doesn't extend through the PSF.
* One very bright streak along right (+DETX) edge of CCD11, increasing in
  intensity down towards readout.  Strongly negative delta means that
  epreject correction ADDED a lot of counts to this CCD edge, peaking around
  +100 or so (doubling strength of this signal).  This is really weird.

In both image subtractions, noise disappears as I increase smoothing in ds9,
indicating that some signal is likely random (e.g., due to uneven binning, true
signal scatter, etc.).  This is especially dramatic in the 0.5-2 keV image,
indicating that epreject had no effect for almost all of the image.


Verdict:
--> epreject: OK.  Keep an eye on instrumental noise / bright
column streaks etc as usual.
--> epnoise: "The purpose of this subtask is to suppress the detector noise at
    energies below ~250 eV and should be used for qualitative imaging purposes
    only."
    Yeah, we can skip this.

## Point source detection and removal

Note there are at least two tools in SAS: `edetect_chain` and `cheese`.  I
don't know the difference between them, so will stick to cheese just to be
consistent in ESAS framework...

First testing with ESAS cheese call on `0551000201/odf/repro` (this has had
epreject run already).

    cheese prefixm="1S001 2S002" prefixp="S003" scale=0.25 rate=1.0 dist=40.0 clobber=0 elow=400 ehigh=7200

It seems like the algorithm works well outside the SNR, but inside it snags on
spurious features.  Let's try two further calls with stricter thresholds:
rate=2, dist=40.

    nohup /bin/tcsh -c 'source sasinit 0551000201; cd 0551000201/odf/repro; cheese prefixm="1S001 2S002" prefixp="S003" scale=0.25 rate=2.0 dist=60.0 clobber=1 elow=400 ehigh=7200'
        >& 20151209_nohup_cheese_0551000201_rate_2_dist_60.log &

        # Ran at 19:50p ish? on statler
        # Forgot to run in background with & at end.

    nohup /bin/tcsh -c 'source sasinit 0087940201; cd 0087940201/odf/repro; cheese prefixm="1S001 2S002" prefixp="S003" scale=0.25 rate=2.0 dist=60.0 clobber=1 elow=400 ehigh=7200'
        >& 20151209_nohup_cheese_0087940201_rate_2_dist_60.log &

        # Ran at 19:54p
        atran@cooper:~/rsch/g309/xmm$ nohup /bin/tcsh -c '...' >& ... &
        [1] 28827

After the fact, I moved `command.csh` files to `cheese_command.csh`


Thursday 2015 December 10 -- iterate on point source removal (cheese)
=====================================================================

## Look at cheese from yesterday

How do the cheese masks look? (scale=0.25, rate=2, dist=60)
Easy way to check -- set up 6 tiled images in DS9 and link frames.

* 0087940201 -- looks good, I think that all sources are real.  PNS003 in
  particular brings out some sources that are more questionable in MOS images.
  But, the bright star HD 119682 is NOT masked.

* 0551000201 -- also looks good.  Two stars that are masked successfully here
  are NOT not masked in 0087940201 (near CCD edges, and off PN entirely in one
  case). Again, the bright star HD 119682 is NOT masked.

It would be nice to use both obsids for source detection.  I could homebrew it
by correcting for exposure and merging, then running wavdetect or similar.  I
don't know what cheese is doing.

Saved DS9 session screenshot to `img-notes/20151210_cheese_assess.png`.

## Make more cheese!

Create and run the script `cheese_grater` to figure out best parameters.
Variant cheese files are named by source detection parameters.
All use the default 0.4-7.2 keV energy band (elow=400, ehigh=7200).

NOTE: some time is consumed by computing exposure maps with:

    eexpmap attitudeset=atthk.fits eventset=mos2S002-clean.fits:EVENTS
        expimageset=mos2S002-exp-im.fits imageset=mos2S002-obj-im.fits
        pimax=7200 pimin=400 withdetcoords=no verbosity=1

To save time, set clobber=0.  Clobber allows us to skip evselect, eexpmask, and
emask creation for all exposures (-obj-im.fits, -exp-im.fits, -mask-im.fits).
The source detection/removal parameters (rate, dist, scale) are first used
around line 520 of cheese to call SAS (ESAS?) task "region".

Detection still takes a while, calls to eboxdetect and esplinemap necessary.

## Histogram (flare filtering checks)

When I try to investigate SWPC emission, filtering may mess up the distribution
of time / spectra somewhat.  Just be aware of this later.

### 0087940201 soft flare filtering

Inspect `*-hist.qdp` files from {mos,pn}-filter.  I'm satisfied with the
filtering, but would make one more edit to cut out events near the start of the
observation (also simplifies the GTIs).
No need to adjust the Gaussian cut.

* MOS1S001: looks OK. I might tighten upper count rate bound to 2.2 cts/sec (fitted
  Gaussian width), but would make little difference based on lightcurve.
  In lightcurve, I would just cut all data from first 10ks of observation;
  a smattering of points are selected, but surrounded by noise.

* MOS2S002: looks OK. Same comments as MOS1S001, basically.

* PNS003: looks OK. I might tighten upper count rate bound to 5.8 cts/sec
  (fitted Gaussian width) vs. ~6.2 cts/s, noise tail more pronounced than in
  MOS plots.  Again, adjustment would make little difference.

  Cut from 0 to 6000 seconds looks good.
  Time from start of observation disagrees with MOS lightcurve, I suspect that
  PN started taking data after MOS, maybe due to a radzone or something.

I'm unsure of the point of the OOT histogram, it looks the same as the
regular PNS003 data (as expected, since they should be the same data...).

In fact, it may be better to have more residual counts, because background
fitting for soft proton power law might be more robust.  I'm not really sure if
we want to go that route though...

### 0551000201 soft flare filtering

Brief noise at very start of observation (0-2ks), decent-ish data in first 20ks
of observation.  Increased noise 20-30ks, some ok data 30-35 ks.  After ~38ks,
flaring increases dramatically and is obviously unusable.
There will definitely be residual contamination.

* MOS1S001: looks ok.  I would tighten upper count rate bound to 1.4 cts/sec
  (vs. 1.7 cts/sec), about 20% correction.
  Cut small bits of data between 19-32ks (from start of MOS time).

* MOS2S002: same deal as MOS1.  Interestingly, lightcurve and count rate
  histogram look subtly better than MOS1, I dunno why.
  Here I'd tighten upper count rate bound to 1.5 cts/sec (from ~1.7 cts/sec)

* PNS003: wow PN looks bad.  Early observation is ok, but after ~20ks the
  flaring is just way too strong.
  Here, I might cut upper count rate bound to 3.3 cts/sec, well below current
  cut at 3.9 cts/sec.
  Similar ratio as my suggested MOS cuts though.
  But that will reduce our already sparse counts further.


Friday 2015 December 11 -- inspect point source removal tests
=============================================================

## Cheese results inspection

NOTE: I have been looking exclusively at 0087940201 masks, to save time.

ESAS Cookbook defaults (already done)
scale=0.25 rate=1 dist=40

    Successfully removes bright star HD119682, but it looks like there's a
    number of false positives.  Holes are pretty big.
    Lots of speckle holes (a few pixels apiece) on MOS2.
    REJECT.

Increase dist alone from default
scale=0.25 rate=1 dist=60

    Mostly the same.  Does NOT remove bright star HD119682.
    More speckle, for some reason.
    Maybe two putative stars, other than the really bright one, are not masked
    as compared to default.
    REJECT.

Increase rate alone from default
scale=0.25 rate=2 dist=40

    Better, much more conservative.
    Holes are same size as default.
    DOES get bright star HD119682.
    This one looks almost optimal, but compare to scale=0.25/rate=2/dist=60 too

Decrease scale from default
scale=0.1 rate=1.0 dist=40.0 clobber=0 elow=400 ehigh=7200

    Exactly as you'd expect, bigger holes...
    REJECT.

Increase scale from default
scale=0.5 rate=1.0 dist=40.0 clobber=0 elow=400 ehigh=7200

    Holes shrink.  Actually, the holes still look pretty good to me,
    but the difference is pretty marginal.
    Looking at DS9 projection of bright star, the cheese mask still looks
    reasonably conservative.
    I would be ok with adopting these smaller holes.

Increase rate and dist from default (already done)
scale=0.25 rate=2 dist=60

    See notes above (Thurs Dec 10)

Increase rate alone, further, from default
scale=0.25 rate=4 dist=40

    As expected. Only some 4-5 stars are masked (includes bright star).
    About two objects that look like stars are not masked.
    A little too conservative, but OK.

Verdict: scale=0.5, rate=2.0, dist=40 seems like a good set of parameters.
scale=0.5 rate=2 dist=40

    I inspect images for both 0087940201 and 0551000201
    0087940201 -- broadly, looks good.  basically same as
      scale=0.25,rate=2,dist=60 assessment from yesterday.
    0551000201 -- the holes are bigger.
      Again, looks like assessment from yesterday, which was positive.
      There's one object being masked in top right
      (RA 13:44:51.036, dec -62:48:46.53) that I'm not sure actually is a point
      source, at least it's not obvious in image.
      But it's completely irrelevant to our work, so I'll leave it in.

I think this is done, I've settled on a set of parameters with which I'm
satisfied.  Very unscientific, but I hope it's OK.


## Next steps

RA/dec for point sources are available in emllist.fits, output by cheese.  Use
this to create simple region masks for any figures necessary.

cheese also outputs emllistout.fits -- this is the original output from
emldetect.  cheese runs task fill_list to fill in null values for something?
so emllist.fits is the correct output file to inspect...
It could be worth inspecting outputs from SAS eboxdetect boxlist.fits and
boxlist-f.fits, but... eh...



Thursday 2015 December 17 -- manual GTI filtering
=================================================

Diverted by planning for JAN1116 load.  Back to work on this.

GTI filtering, following assessment from last Thurs (Dec 10).  I defer from
count rate filtering; just apply some obvious time interval cuts.
- based on lightcurve, not obvious that further count rate filtering has
  obvious effects
- lose more photons, which may be meaningful esp. at high energy
- somewhat tricky to reproduce. we'd have to create binned light curve files
  from evselect, then use tabgtigen to make new GTIs.
  Not hard, but figuring out the lightcurves generated by espfilt is a bit of
  trouble.
- more eyeballing.
- may be helpful to have residual photons since we are subtracting or fitting
  background anyways.

For all these, I take the start times to be TSTART in the FITS headers of
mos1S001-ori.fits, mos2S002-ori.fits, pnS003-ori.fits

From XMM-SAS selectlib doc page (and corroborated by hand):
> In an arithmetic context all given times evaluate to the number of elapsed
> seconds since the fixed time 1998-01-01T00:00:00 TT.

## 0087940201 GTIs

* 0087940201 MOS1S001 -- cut all intervals before 10000 sec
    = 1.15354430246723E+08 + 10,000 sec
    --> Cut times before 115,364,430 sec
* 0087940201 MOS2S002 -- same as for MOS1
    = 1.15354431376978E+08 + 10,000 sec
    MOS2 first frame ~1.1 sec. after MOS1, according to TSTART.
    --> Cut times before 115,364,431 sec
* 0087940201 PNS003 -- cut all intervals before 6000 sec
    = 1.15358540104471E+08 + 6,000 sec
    PN first frame ~ 4.11ks after MOS1/MOS2 started, per TSTART
    --> Cut times before 115,364,540 sec

For 0087940201, filter event lists to use ONLY events after 115,364,540 sec;
simply taking the maximum of the cut time estimates.

## 0551000201 GTIs

* 0551000201 MOS1S001 -- cut between 19-32ks of MOS time.
* 0551000201 MOS2S002 -- cut between 19.5-32ks of MOS time.
* 0551000201 PNS003 -- cut everything after 30ks.  There's a snippet of signal,
  but surrounded by flaring noise.

    atran(sas)@treble$ fkeypar mos1S001-ori.fits TSTART ; pget fkeypar value
    3.52724237093625E+08
    atran(sas)@treble$ fkeypar mos2S002-ori.fits TSTART ; pget fkeypar value
    3.52724235780930E+08
    atran(sas)@treble$ fkeypar pnS003-ori.fits TSTART ; pget fkeypar value
    3.52725946564511E+08

Let's adopt: MOS, cut 19.5-32ks; PN cut >30ks
    MOS1 TSTART = 352,724,237 seconds; cut between 352,743,736 and 352,756,237 sec.
    MOS2 TSTART = 352,724,236 seconds; as above
    PN TSTART = 352,725,947 seconds; cut all after 352,755,947 sec.

## Implementation

NASA's XMM GOF "ABC guide" describes a few implementations:
    http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xmm/abc/node8.html#SECTION00850000000000000000

I move some files around and run evselect to apply filters
(long diversion finagling with details of evselect parameters, and determining
why withfilteredset is not a documented parameter...)

Run evselect to generate NEW light curves for comparison.  A few points don't
quite agree; from looking at plot, this appears to occur at edge of GTIs
(though I didn't formally verify this).  If I change binning (timebinsize) to 1
second, this problem seems to go away.

In this process, I turned up an error in my notes.  Both PN and MOS exposures
are filtered with flag 0x766a0f63, for both 0551000201 AND 0087940201.
Steve Snowden uses 0x766a0763 for unfiltered detector images for REVL > 2383,
for both MOS and PN; but, espfilt has already filtered on 0x766a0f63 to create
the cleaned events file.

Anyways, I made the new light curves.  Maybe the GTIs can be adjusted, in
particular for the latter half of 0551000201 (where I accept about 8ks of MOS
time, but reject all the PN time).

But for now it seems OK.

Quick check on exposure times:
0087940201 mos2S002-clean.fits ONTIME = 25.891 ks, LIVETIME = 25.621 ks (central CCD)
0087940201 mos2S002-clean-ori.fits ONTIME = 28.440 ks, LIVETIME = 28.119 ks (central CCD)
    OK, as expected, a fair bit of time was trimmed; lost ~3ks (10%).

OK, I think it worked successfully.

Realized that my final filtering was removing corner pixels; added corners back
in to event lists for spectrum extraction.

Current list of pending procedure changes (copied from Mon 2015 Dec 7):
2. fix PN spectrum extraction for 0551000201
    -- in works, deciding how to work without QPB, we'd need different
    procedure.  Defer temporarily, I will work out a few more things on
    0087940201 first.

    Remark: epchain doc claims that its runbackground=Y mode is able to create
    background spectrum for LW imaging mode.  But, looking at XMM-Newton sky
    FOV in DS9, this seems impossible...


Monday 2015 December 21 -- spectrum extraction pipeline

We have a few different steps.
Let's start with the easiest, which is to just pull out spectra from
source/background regions and do a simplistic subtraction.

I prepare some event lists without corner events for manual extraction.

mos-filter, mos-spectra, pn-spectra output their commands to command.csh --
move and save this file after each call, to prevent from being clobbered (and
to have an easy to peruse log of commands run)
CURIOUSLY, pn-filter doesn't do this...  pn-filter does create an empty
../../catalogue file, I don't know why though?

## emchain synopsis, distilled from docs / outputs

	* Find and merge GTIs from attitude (spacecraft pointing), housekeeping, and (optionally) user-supplied GTI file
      - Many of these GTI files float around after the emchain run (ATTGTI, HK_GTI, FBKTSR, FBKGTI),
	    as well as the spacecraft attitude file generated by `atthkgen atthkset=P{obsid}OBX000ATTTSR0000.FIT`
	  - By default, _these are not actually applied to data_
	* Remove all bad events, except `OUT_OF_FOV` and `REJECTED_BY_GATTI`
	  - Flag: 0x762aa000; compare to XMMEA_EM 0x766ba000.  As claimed, this only
	    differs by allowing OUT_OF_FOV and REJECTED_BY_GATTI events which
	    correspond to 0x00010000 and 0x00400000 respectively)
	* Merge event lists from all CCDs, create a final event list w/ information for imaging.
      this includes, e.g., using attitude history to compute sky X/Y for each event;
	  identifying and applying GTIs for individual CCDs; etc.
	* Create flare time series and GTIs (for MOS1 and MOS2 both), but doesn't apply by default
	  - flare removal is conservative, uses high energy events and cuts, based on "flaremaxrate" and "flaretimebin".

	Result: a minimally processed event list for all CCDs, preserving events outside FOV and high energy (rejected by "GATTI") events.
	Most bad events are rejected, but for spectra further filtering may be desired (XMMEA_SM flag)

	* By default, HK, ATT, and flare filtering are NOT applied to data (filteratt, filterhk, applyflaregti)
	  You'll notice that there are no calls to gtimerge in emchain.log
	* Events are randomized within position, energy, time bins
	* Some intermediate files generated by emchain/epchain can be reused in subsequent calls

## epchain synopsis, distilled from docs / outputs

	* Process bad pixels, GTIs, etc. and get calibrated events for each CCD (option to remove low energy noise + soft flares via epreject, epnoise; off by default)
	* Combine into output events list.
	* Obtain background lightcurve + GTIs after applying indiv CCD masks (not applied to events list) (FBKTSR, FBKGTI)
	* OOT case: treat all events as OOT and randomly shuffle along RAWY column, to create "simulated readout streaks" that can be subtracted from images and spectra
	  Thread on how to subsequently subtract OOT events from images and spectra using FTOOLS, evselect, etc:

  	    http://xmm.esac.esa.int/sas/current/documentation/threads/EPIC_OoT.shtml

	Typically run as:
		withoutoftime=Y keepintermediate=raw
	then run a second time as:
		withoutoftime=N (is default and can thus be omitted) 

	Result:
		P0551000201OBX000ATTTSR0000.FIT		atthkgen output
		P0551000201PNS003BPXHMK00##.FIT		badpixfind, hard band pt src. mask?  for CCDs 1-12

	I haven't figured out what the badpixfind masks (BPXHMK, BPXMSK) are for, but oh well.

## Subtasks within epchain

	epnoise: "calculates the number of events per frame between 20 to 30 adu
		and removes those frames above a certain thershold defined by noisecut
		parameter. Once the noisy frames have been removed, the exposure time is
		updated accordingly."

		removes soft X-ray noisy frames (what is a frame? single readout event?)

		(how critical is this?  is this covered by our flare filtering?)

	epreject: offset map calculation may get distorted by particles

		Context: EPIC-pn computes an offset map just before the start of an
		exposure.  This map contains the energy offset for each pixel (in
		analog-to-digital units, adu). During the exposure, these offsets are
		subtracted onboard from the measured signals, and only events where the
		difference exceeds 20 adu (~100 eV) are transmitted to Earth.

		ALSO suppresses detector noise at low energies?  Depends on distance to readout node.
		http://xmm.esac.esa.int/sas/current/doc/epreject/node5.html

		 Compared to the sky background, the detector background is characterized by

			> a non-uniform spatial distribution: the detector background is not
			> vignetted, but rather increases toward the CAMEX chip (to the top and to the
			> bottom in figure 9 or figure 10) , with a steep rise in the rows closest to the
			> CAMEX

			> a non-uniform spectral distribution: noticeable detector background
			> is present only below a few hundred eV, with a steep rise toward the lowermost
			> energies This subtask is intended to simplify the background subtraction at low
			> energies. It makes use of the fact that the noise properties of EPIC pn vary
			> with position and energy, but are fairly stable in time.

		RESULTS:
		1. energy scale shift over entire spectral bandwidth
		2. detector noise because previously rejected events may be promoted to "valid" events

		See: http://xmm.esac.esa.int/external/xmm_user_support/documentation/sas_usg/USG/correpicimag.html
		http://xmm.esac.esa.int/sas/current/doc/epreject/node4.html

		(now, this sounds important, and relatively low impact correction, esp if you need line centroids.
		 But, why is it turned off in epchain by default?  It's enabled for timing/burst modes, though.)

## mos-filter synopsis

Review of mos-filter (any functionality I should incorporate?):

    $good=substep()
	...
	for each (event lists produced by emchain)

		espfilt eventset=mos".$rot_name.".fits  # Main filtering step

		rename the files (e.g., -objevlifilt.FIT to -clean.fits)

		print useful information from FITS file keywords. Notably, I can get livetime/ontime:

			atran(sas)@treble$ fkeypar mos1-filt.fits ONTIME ; pget fkeypar value ;
			3.96479230155498E+04
			atran(sas)@treble$ fkeypar mos1-filt.fits LIVETIME ; pget fkeypar value ;
			3.92745418829918E+04

			2.76000000000000E+04
			atran(sas)@treble$ fkeypar P0087940201M1S001-objevlifilt.FIT LIVETIME ; pget fkeypar value ;
			2.72832182419300E+04

			Compare this to XMM archive stated duration of 40.463 ks.
			Unfiltered on/live time: 39.65 ks, 39.27 ks
			Filtered on/live time: 27.60 ks, 27.28 ks

			I assume on/live corresponds to some CCD downtime; difference is ~1%.
				ONTIME = sum of GTIs for the central CCD
				LIVETIME = live time for the central CCD

		create "diagnostic" images (line 125-166):
			image in DETX/DETY coords, unfiltered
			image in DETX/DETY coords, soft (0.2-0.9 keV) x-rays, mildly filtered
				(Snowden adds an additional filter flag if $ins_num==1 and $revl > 2383,
					(((FLAG & 0x766a0f63) == 0)||((FLAG & 0x766a0763) == 0))
				 vs. just
					((FLAG & 0x766a0f63) == 0)
				for the regular case)
				After very long exploration -- this is equivalent to just using 0x766a0763 alone.
				(0763 vs 0f63).  Special case appears to correspond to MOS1
			 	events taken after the CCD3 micrometeorite strike (in revolution 2382)

				Snowden's filter is actually LESS restrictive after rev 2383
				than before. Not sure why.

			image in DETX/DETY, filtered
			image in SKY X/Y, filtered

		create corner definition for MOS1 and MOS2 (different for each)
		manually extract corner-only events files, with mild filtering (like above, with 0x766a0{f,7}63)
		create image of corner-only events

		calculate count rate, hardness ratio??? for each chip.
			Very dense evselect expressions follow, selecting 0.3-10 keV, 0.5-0.8 keV, 2.5-5 keV.
			It looks like yes, for each CCD chip, Snowden computes some kind of spectrum info.
			I assume this helps filter on anomalous MOS CCDs.

			and then prints out the ones that look anomalous or potentially anomalous!

	AND THAT'S IT!

Basically a giant wrapper for espfilt, that generates a lot of diagnostic output.  Kind of useful.

## mos-spectra synopsis

mos-spectra extracts many spectra from varying regions (FOV, chip corners,
region of interest, etc.).  It filters with a lot of buried/embedded patterns.
But, the spectra are not actually manipulated.

mos-spectra handles the following:
* hardcodes CCD regions for MOS1 and MOS2
* removes bad edge of MOS1 CCD#4 (after loss of CCD#3 in 2012)
* obtains/applies hardcoded sky masks if specified (mask=1,2,3)
* extracts corner event file (mos1S001-corn.fits) if not already present.  would apply expression='pattern<=12, (flag & 0x766a0f63) == 0'
  (but, this file is already obtained from mos-filter (espfilt) by moving -corevlifilt.FIT to -corn.fits)
* anomalous CCD check, again.

Here are the output files, in approx. order of generation.  Substitute "1S001" with appropriate prefix.
Most of these files are independent of each other; exposure maps/masks go together; pi/rmf/arf go together.

	mos1S001-obj-im.fits					obs data img in sky coords, full FOV, all (selected) CCDs, all energies
	mos1S001-obj-im-sp-det.fits				obs data img in det coords, selected region (used for task proton-scale)
	mos1S001-obj-im-det-400-1250.fits		obs data img in det coords, selected region, all (selected) CCDs, 400-1250 eV
	atthk.fits								attitude data for exposure maps (atthkset=atthk.fits timestep=1)
	mos1S001-exp-im.fits					exposure map for full FOV (from mos1S001-obj-im.fits)
	mos1S001-mask-im.fits					exposure mask (essentially, full FOV minus deselected CCDs)

	mos1S001-obj.pi							obs data spectrum, selected region
	mos1S001.rmf							RMF for -obj.pi, computed using temporary detmaparray (detmap.ds, obs data img in det coords, FLAG==0 only)
	mos1S001.arf							ARF for -obj.pi, computed using same detmaparray and RMF as well (extendedsource flag enabled)

	mos1S001-obj-im-400-1250.fits			obs data img in sky coords, selected region, 400-1250 eV
	mos1S001-exp-im-400-1250.fits			exposure map for region and band
	mos1S001-mask-im-400-1250.fits			exposure mask for region and band

	mos1S001-1ff.pi							FWC data spectrum for intersection(selected region, CCD #1); FLAG == 0 required
	mos1S001-obj-im-400-1250-ccd1.fits		obs img for central chip, selected region, 400-1250 eV
	mos1S001-exp-im-400-1250-ccd1.fits		exposure map for obs central img
	mos1S001-mask-im-400-1250-ccd1.fits		exposure mask for obs central img
	mos1S001-im1-400-1250.fits				FWC img for central chip, selected region, 400-1250 eV; masked with "mos1S001-mask-im-400-1250-ccd1.fits"
	mos1S001-1obj.pi						obs spectrum for central chip

	mos1S001-2oc.pi							obs corner spectrum, CCD#2
	mos1S001-2obj.pi						obs data spectrum in intersection(CCD#2, selected region)
	mos1S001-2fc.pi							FWC corner spectrum, CCD#2
	mos1S001-2ff.pi							FWC spectrum in intersection(CCD#2, selected region)
	mos1S001-im2-400-1250.fits				FWC image in intersection(CCD#2, selected region, 400-1250 eV)

	... (repeat for CCDS 3-7)

Note that the FWC images/spectra (mos1S001-im1-400-1250.fits, mos1S001-2fc.pi,
mos1S001-im2-400-1250.fits, ...) are all extracted from mos1-fwc.fits.gz, part
of the ESAS CALDB.  This file looks like a bunch of FWC data all merged
together.

## mos\_back, pn\_back "synopsis"

Scripts mos\_back / pn\_back are compiled Fortran, unfortunately, so I can't
decipher what they do directly.  What do they output?

    mos{prefix}-aug.qdp - QDP plot showing the selected region of hardness/count rate distributions for the various ccds.
    mos{prefix}-back-im-det-elow-ehigh.fits - model particle background image, det coords,  for selected energy band (elow and ehigh) and selected region
    mos{prefix}-back.pi - model particle background spectrum for selected region.
    mos{prefix}-spec.qdp - QDP plot showing the observed spectrum and the model background spectrum.

    Additional output when diag=2:
    mos{prefix}-back.qdp - QDP plot showing the normalized model background spectrum.
    mos{prefix}-back-accum.qdp - QDP plot showing the accumulating background spectrum. Chip 1 at the bottom increasing upwards.
    mos{prefix}-bridge-fit.qdp - QDP plot showing the the fit for the Al-Si bridge.

SO, mos{prefix}-obj.pi (with arf,rmf) is to be used with mos{prefix}-back.pi.
You need to set BACKSCALE keyword and stuff appropriately.  After this, you're
supposed to fit instrumental lines + cosmic (galactic + extragalactic) X-ray
background yourself.




FAQ (things I was somewhat stumped on at some point)
====================================================

Q: What's the difference between epproc/emproc and epchain/emchain?
A: Same thing, script vs. compiled implementation.  Maybe chains are better?
> There are two types of tool available, the procs (epproc and emproc) and the
> chains (epchain and emchain) which do essentially the same job. However, the

Flare removal by GTI cuts decreases error compared to blank sky subtraction
===========================================================================

Tuesday Oct 6 2015

What's the better way to remove flares from spectra: cutting time intervals of
significant flaring, or subtracting blank sky background?

Flares are ~10x the source count rate during flaring periods (note that MOS/PN
histogram of FOV count rate are likely dominated by the bright star HD119682,
and SNR is probably 2-10x fainter).

	Counts in filtered image (flares completely removed; original event list cleaned with XMMEA_EM and espfilt):
	- SNR: 0.077 cts/arcsec^2    / 27ks     -->  2.85e-3 ct/ks/arcsec^2
	- blank sky: 0.04 cts/arcsec^2  / 27ks  -->  1.48e-3 ct/ks/arcsec^2

	Counts in unfiltered image (original event list; no filtering for bad events, but there should be very few of those):
	- SNR: 0.217 cts/arcsec^2   / 40ks    	-->  5.43e-3 ct/ks/arcsec^2
	- blank sky: 0.165 cts/arcsec   / 40ks	-->  4.13e-3 ct/ks/arcsec^2

SNR is ~ 1.4e-3 ct/ks/arcsec, without blank sky background (instrumental, sky, etc. all in one)
Flaring is ~2.6e-3 ct/ks/arcsec^2, roughly 2x SNR brightness.  But flaring is concentrated in 13 of 40 ks.

	Estimated SNR counts (40 ks): 0.056 ct/arcsec^2
	Estimated flare counts (40 ks, but concentrated within 13 ks): 0.10 ct/arcsec^2
	Estimated SNR counts (13 ks): 0.018 ct/arcsec^2

Flares thus cause count rates ~10x brighter than actual SNR (after background removal), over the span of 13 ks.
But, what matters is the total error over 40ks.

	SNR alone (40 ks): 0.056*A +/- sqrt(0.056*A) ct

			relative error: sqrt(0.056*A) / (0.056*A) ~ 4.23 / sqrt(A)

	SNR alone (27 ks): 0.038*A +/- sqrt(0.038*A) ct

			relative error: sqrt(0.038*A) / (0.038*A) ~ 5.13 / sqrt(A)

	SNR (40 ks) - flare (13 ks): 0.056*A +/- sqrt(0.056*A) +/- sqrt(2*0.10*A) ct

			relative error: sqrt(0.256*A) / (0.056*A) ~ 9.04 / sqrt(A)

Adding errors in quadrature. flare subtraction using another region introduces sqrt(2 * flare cts) uncertainty.
This is a very rough estimate, but it looks like we almost double the relative error, as opposed to simply cutting out flare times.

Flares in different parts of FOV are definitely correlated.  So subtraction
process may not introduce that much error if the "actual" Poissonian error in
flare counts from one part of the FOV to another is similar (or, it doesn't
make sense to represent the counts as random discrete events).

So the error for blank sky subtraction is likely not as bad as I estimate.
Nevertheless, simply taking GTIs seems to be the safest approach.
