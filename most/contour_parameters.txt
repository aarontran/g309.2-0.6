Radio contours (g309_linear.con,lev), extracted 2015 Nov 16, for images and manual
region extraction.

## Remarks

Min: -0.011 Jy/beam
Max:  0.204 Jy/beam

Note that the 98% limits are -0.009 to 0.087 Jy/beam; that is, the top half of the
brightness range (0.1-0.2 Jy/beam) is concentrated in ~1-2% of the image
pixels -- the bipolar hot spots of the remnant.

## Contours

I chose 20 contour levels: 0.01, 0.02, ... 0.2 in DS9.  Generation parameters:
    smoothness = 1
    levels = 21 (manually remove level 0 Jy/beam, contour is too noisy)
    method = block (default)

and added command to regenerate in makefile.
NOTE: to reduce contour filesize, up the smoothness parameter.
