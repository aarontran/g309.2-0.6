To download data (including ESAS filterwheel closed data + diagonal RMFs for
MOS1, MOS2, PN), run from this top-level directory (xmm/):

    make all

This will download and unpackage data for obsids 0087940201 and 0551000201, and
run XMM-SAS odfingest and cifbuild (via script sasrepro).

To set-up an interactive environment for SAS/ESAS, run:

    source sasinit ${obsid}

which sets the environment variable ${XMM_PATH} to provide access to scripts
from deep within data directories.

To pass data through the processing pipeline, run:

    source sasinit ${obsid}
    cd ${obsid}/odf/repro
    chainfilter_${obsid}
    specbackgrp_${obsid}

The chainfilter/specbackgrp scripts should be nearly the same, but may have
some variations for each dataset.

This pipeline will almost certainly become more messy / convoluted as I try
fiddling with different parts of the process.  More TBD!...
