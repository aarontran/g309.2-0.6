A bunch of files and scripts from October 2015, when I was trying to
troubleshoot ESAS-generated spectra; I was perplexed by the presence of an
unusually hard tail at high energy.

The answer is that, the hard tail can be modeled by a power law component NOT
folded through the detector response, which describes soft protron
contamination (not removed by GTI filtering).

This is all described in the ESAS cookbook.
