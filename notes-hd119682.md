Notes on HD119682 distance determination, classification.
Not that important, but good to keep on hand.


I don't see that stellar classification work (e.g., Marco 2009)
necessarily says anything about distance to the star.
But it provides circumstantial evidence if such blue stragglers are
preferentially associated with globular clusters -- I have no idea if that's true.

Absorption -> distance provides a strong constraint.
absorping column through the bright -60km/s feature
(Cen/Scutum/something-or-other milky way arm) is probably about 1e22.
given that nH calculators are spitting out absorptions of ~ 1-2e22.

I don't understand how stellar distances are calculated
(my best guess right now is that, e.g., Kharchenko+ 2005 is placing
cluster stars on an isochrone after making an extinction correction,
then converting apparent to absolute magnitudes -> distance modulus
which is basically distance.
distance to cluster: kharchenko et al. 2005A&A...438.1163K
they get distance = 1.108 kpc, i don't know how?!
Kharchenko+ use E(B-V) = 0.27 mag. vs. Lotkin+'s value 0.225 mag.
partial answer -- interstellar extinction and isochrones...

BUT, that's OK because absorption and the converging stellar classification
as a gamma cas analog / blue straggler, strongly favor that this is a
foreground star.

NON-condensed version
\citet{rakowski06} state O9e stellar classification from
    Magellan H-alpha (<$0.75\arcsec$), Chandra ACIS-S; Chandra/XMM CCD spectrum fits
    Sanner 2001:
        cluster distance 1.58 +/- 0.15 kpc,
        HD 119682 membership probability ~ 0.78 from proper motion
    Levenhagen and Leister 2006:
        spectroscopic parameters of HD 119682

    Rakowski+ state O9.7 classification based on T 31910 +/- 550 K from
        Levenhagen/Leister and "updated determinations of O star effective
        temperatures that account for line blanketing (Martins+ 2002)"

    Basically - positional overlap -- ruling out neighboring stars to 0.006 pc
    (1240 AU)... assuming bright enough i guess (magnitude limited?... i don't
    know anything about stars yet).  Better than 1 arcsec agreement.

    How did people determine luminosity??????
    Doesn't that assume a distance?...
    - what is an isochrone
    - what "are" blue stragglers
    - what is a bolometric luminosity
    - how do you distinguish late O vs. early B star, does it even matter
    - how did levenhagen/leister deduce a mass?... stellar evolutionary tracks...

\citet{safi-harb07} state Be classification...


There is ALSO a recent study of the foreground OB association kinematics:
