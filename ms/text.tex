\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

Motivations:
(1) typing remnants by ejecta,
(2) resolve ejecta spatial structure (layering, mixing),
(3) resolve interaction with surrounding medium

Individual object study to build information for more ambitious global studies
of remnant properties and interaction with the ISM -- not undertaken here.
Just one piece of a puzzle.

We present the first ``modern'' high-resolution X-ray image of G309.2-0.6 based
on two archival XMM-Newton observations.  We fit the CCD spectra of
morphologically distinct regions of the remnant to map the distribution of
ejecta abundances, plasma temperature, and ionization states.

\subsection{Previous observations of G309.2-0.6}

% Radio remnant observations and morphology
G309.2-0.6 (J2000 RA 13h46m30s, dec. $-62\arcdeg 54\arcmin 00\arcsec$) was
discovered in Molonglo $408 \unit{MHz}$ and Parkes $5000 \unit{MHz}$ surveys
\citep{clark1973, green1974, clark1975}, and has since been observed multiple
times by southern radio telescopes \citep{caswell1981, kesteven1987,
whiteoak1996, gaensler1998}.
\citet{gaensler1998} (hereafter, \citetalias{gaensler1998}) provide the most
comprehensive radio study to date based upon Australia Telescope Compact Array
(ATCA) $1.344 \unit{GHz}$ continuum and $1.420 \unit{GHz}$ HI observations at
angular resolution $24\arcsec$.
The radio remnant is a circular shell with two bright lobes to the NE and SW,
hereafter referred to as ``ears'' (Fig \ref{fig:snr}).
Its flux density at $843 \unit{MHz}$ is $\abt 6 \unit{Jy}$, corresponding to a
surface brightness $5.4\times10^{-21} \unit{W \; m^{-2} \; Hz^{-1} \; sr^{-1}}$
\citep{whiteoak1996}.
% Comment: Bryan's ATCA data are publically available, but no real motivation
% to download and reduce at this time
% TODO -- we could provide surface brightness for the bright ears alone

% X-ray remnant observation(s) and morphology
X-ray emission was discovered in an Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and
Astrophysics (ASCA) survey of small remnants by \citet{rakowski2001}
(hereafter, \citetalias{rakowski2001}).
The X-ray remnant sits within the radio shell and is brightest towards the
north (Figure \ref{fig:snr}).
A faint X-ray arc on the remnant's northeast limb coincides with the radio
shell's limb and is most apparent in our $0.8$--$1.4 \unit{keV}$ band image.
Both radio ears are X-ray dark.

% Other wavelengths
The field of G309.2-0.6 has been well-observed in galactic plane surveys in
many wavelengths.
No H$\alpha$ filaments are observed (\textbf{SOURCE}) % TODO
% OH maser
No $1720.5 \unit{MHz}$ OH maser emission is observed above $40 \unit{mJy}$
\citep{green1997}.
Infrared images (Spitzer IRAC 3.6,4.5,5.8,$8 \unit{{\mu}m}$, MIPSGAL, WISE)
don't show any morphological features that, by eye, could be associated with
the remnant.
% Mopra CO survey - no public data yet, in works

\paragraph{Properties}

\textbf{These paragraphs could be each condensed into 1-2 sentences.}

% Galactic environment
The sight line towards G309.2-0.6 crosses the tangent of the Centaurus Arm
(variously Scu-Cen, Crux-Cen, Scu-Crux) and the near and far Carina arm at
$\abt 1.5 \unit{kpc}$ and $\abt 14 \unit{kpc}$.  Molecular and HI emission is
dominated by the Centaurus Arm at line-of-sight velocities $-70$ to
$-20 \unit{km/s}$ \citep[e.g.,][Figure 4]{dame2011}, and a good number of
molecular clouds can be identified \citep{rice2016}.  The field is well
populated with unrelated but independently interesting features.

% Remnant distance in HI
The remnant distance is estimated to be within $5$--$14 \unit{kpc}$ based on HI
absorption out to the galactic rotation curve's tangent point, $v_{\mt{LSR}}
\sim -50 \unit{km/s}$, and a lack of absorption above $v_{\mt{LSR}} \sim +40
\unit{km/s}$ \citepalias{gaensler1998}.  The galactic rotation curve is from
\citet{fich1989} with galactic center distance $R_0 = 8.5 \unit{kpc}$ and local
circular velocity $\Theta = 220 \unit{km/s}$.

% sigma-D estimate of distance
From the somewhat questionable $\Sigma$-$D$ relation, \citet{pavlovic2014}
provide a distance estimate of $5.9 \unit{kpc}$.
This is fraught with peril.
At least the relation of \citet{pavlovic2014} is calibrated for shell-type
radio remnants.
See also \citet{huang1985} which presents a $\Sigma$-$D$ relation for
shell-like remnants also interacting with clouds -- which helps constrain the
expected brightness.
The scatter looks like there's no correlation at all to my eye -- and this is
already in log-log space, where one can fit a straight line to many things
easily.
I wonder if there's some way to adjust the results based on local density
estimates, or just blindly regress against multiplicative combinations of other
salient physical variables.
Nevertheless, we'll present the result, since it is at least partially
physically motivated.

\paragraph{Environment}

% HD 119682 - previous interest and subsequent disassociation
A bright ROSAT source (1WGA J1346.5--6255) within G309.2-0.6 is the foreground
Be star HD 119682.
The source's position within a bilobed radio remnant led
\citetalias{gaensler1998} and \citetalias{rakowski2001} to suggest that
G309.2-0.6 might be a jet- or outflow-driven remnant, similar to the SS 443 /
W50 system.
% bilobed beats bilobate on Google by 278 to 66 (cf. Google ngrams)
But, HD 119682 is likely a member of the open cluster NGC 5281 at a distance
$\abt 1.4 \unit{kpc}$, based on X-ray and optical astrometry, cluster proper
motions, and X-ray spectrum fits \citep{rakowski2006, safi-harb2007,
torrejon2013}.
% The X-ray fitted absorption of $\nH \sim 0.2 \times 10^{22} \unit{cm^{-2}}$
% is consistent with the inferred distance to HD 119682 \citep{rakowski2006,
% safi-harb2007, torrejon2013}.

% Gum 48d / RCW 80
The H II region Gum 48d (RCW 80) lies to the north of G309.2-0.6.
Gum 48d is well traced out in HI, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
emission, and warm dust; assuming these emission features all correspond to the
same H II region, the distance to Gum 48d is $\abt 3.5\unit{kpc}$, based on
ionized gas emission velocities (H$\alpha$, HI) distance estimates to the
central star system HR 5171 \citep{karr2009}.
The distance estimate to Gum 48d, in conjunction with a lack of evidence for
remnant-cloud interaction, suggest that Gum 48d is also a foreground feature
unrelated to the remnant G309.2-0.6.  The practical consequence is that we will
subsequently ignore a north-south wisp of radio emission that appears to
connect the radio remnant and H II region.

% Centaurus CO cloud
Given the remnant's rough radio and X-ray symmetry, we may be able to disfavor
a location within the Centaurus arm.  \citet{saito2001} imaged
an extensive molecular CO complex in ${}^{12}$CO, ${}^{13}$CO, and C${}^{18}$O
J=(1-0) transitions at line-of-sight velocities $-64$ to $-36 \unit{km/s}$.
\textbf{TODO} this would need some CO to ISM density conversion estimate so
that we could estimate a density gradient across the remnant, if it were
associated with this cloud (which we think it is not).
For this see Bolatto, Wolfire and Leroy (2013).
It is clear that remnants expanding into a density gradient need not look that
asymmetric \citep{williams2013}, so \textbf{this is speculative and may be
outright wrong}.
But, I think we can start thinking about what kind of environments may be
relevant for this remnant's evolution.
% H II region = blob of natal stardust, shoved out and compressed by
% young OB star's radiation pressure, interacting with ambient ISM, nearby
% stars and clouds, etc...
%
% Here's a lovely optical photograph, clearly showing the bright H II region and
% the bluer star cluster NGC 5281 to the south:
% https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RCW_80.jpg

% Mopra CO J(1-0) survey, resolution 30 arcsec and 0.1 km/s, would be huge!
% Looking at our crude rotation curve -- beyond tangent point, 100 km/s per 10kpc
% is the approximate slope; 0.1 km/s means we have a distance resolution of order
% 10 parsecs, comparable to or smaller than this remnant size.
% Compare, Dame survey has beamwidth ~ 1/8 deg. = 7.5 arcmin = 450 arcsec

% Emailed a feedback query on 2016 April 13... probably won't have much luck.

% TODO: check out ATCA J134649--625235, mentioned in Gaensler

% Summary / wrap-up
\citetalias{gaensler1998} and \citetalias{rakowski2001} have given the most comprehensive radio and
X-ray imaging studies of G309.2-0.6 to date.
The remnant has received little attention since -- not unsurprising for its
location in the southern sky, overlapping foreground objects, and non-detection
of clearly associated emission outside of radio and X-ray wavelengths.
Here, we provide the first spatially resolved X-ray study of this remnant based
entirely on archived XMM-Newton observations.

\section{Observations and Data Reduction} \label{sec:obs}

%% High-level summary of our usable data

XMM-Newton's European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) observed G309.2-0.6 for a
total of $97.73 \unit{ks}$ in two pointings on 2001 August 28 and 2009 March
6--7.  The first pointing (obsid 0087940201; PI John P. Hughes) was $40.46
\unit{ks}$ with MOS1/2 in Full Frame mode, PN in Extended Full Frame mode, and
XMM's ``thick'' optical filter.
The second pointing (obsid 0551000201; PI Christian Motch) was $57.27
\unit{ks}$  with MOS1/2 in Full Frame mode, PN in Large Window mode, and XMM's
``medium'' optical filter.  The proposal targeted the X-ray bright foreground
Be star HD 119682, but as a byproduct captured the remnant G309.2-0.6.  The NE
edge of the remnant is cut-off by the disabled MOS1 CCD3 and the PN Large
Window mode boundary, but a majority of the remnant's area and its brightest
emission are captured on the central CCDs of all three detectors.

%% TODO I have not thought at all about the effects of optical loading
%% on these observations...

We reprocess the data with XMM Science Analysis System (SAS) v15.0.0, released
on 2016 February 4, using standard tasks: cifbuild, emchain, epchain,
including an execution of epchain for out-of-time events.

Point source removal -- in particular, the excision region for the bright
foreground star HD 119682 is \textbf{XXX} in diameter... which should capture x
amount.  Leave x amount of contamination, compared to X-ray surface brightness
elsewhere.

After SAS/ESAS processing as detailed below, we obtain X and Y good times
(Table 1) with a total of XXX counts and XXX counts

The data are ??? affected by soft proton flares.

Two CCDs in the Motch dataset were unusable -- MOS1 CCD6 after the ~2005

%% Omission of 0551000201 PN
Because no corner counts were recorded by the PN in 0551000201,
and the SP contamination is even more severe than for MOS1/MOS2 in 0551000201
(our basic filtering criterion yielded X amount of good time, interspersed with
x)
we excluded that exposure from our analysis.  This is a $\abt 10\%$ loss of
exposure time.

\subsection{Data filtering}

%% ESAS -- flare filtering, SAS flagging, QPB generation
We use the Extended SAS software (Kuntz and Snowden, 2008)
to prepare the data, filter out soft proton flare intervals (as identified by X
criterion by SAS task?),
apply SAS event criterion flags (PATTERN, FLAG)

\subsection{Instrumental Background}

(briefly explain FWC data and XMM instrumental lines in a short paragraph)

%% ESAS
We use ESAS tasks ? and ? to model the MOS and PN quiescent particle background
(QPB).
The QPB represents continuum detector emission from XMM FWC closed data,
specifically selected where the FWC corner spectra have spectral hardness
similar to that of the current observation (Kuntz and Snowden, 2008, Sec. ??).
In the regions where fluorescent instrumental lines are strong, ESAS
interpolates the continuum.  We subtract the QPB directly from observation
spectra.

%% FWC instrumental line fits
To model instrumental lines, we fit FWC spectra with zero-width, fixed-energy
gaussians and assume that the relative line strengths (i.e., line ratios) are
the same between FWC and observation spectra.
For MOS exposures, we fit FWC spectra to a broken power-law continuum with two
Gaussian lines at $1.49$ (Al) and $1.75 \unit{keV}$ (Si).
For PN, we fit seven Gaussian lines at $1.49$ (Al), $4.54$ (Ti), $5.44$ (Cr),
$7.49$ (Ni), $8.05$ (Cu), $8.62$ (Zn), and $8.90 \unit{keV}$ (Cu K-beta).
The PN Ti and Cr lines are not obvious in observation spectra, but
appear clearly in FWC spectra.
To fit instrumental lines in observation spectra, we import and fix line
normalizations from FWC fits, then vary a constant prefactor for all
instrumental lines in a given exposure.

\subsection{Astrophysical Background}

Elemental abundances by Wilms et al. (2000)
and the "tbabs" model in XSPEC (Arnaud 1996).

Will be useful to provide physical units for background emission, and compare
to other measurements.

\paragraph{Soft proton contamination}

Loads of it, everywhere.
ESAS approach: qpb includes only highly energetic CR penetration.
% http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xmm/esas/cookbook/xmm-esas.html#foot986
the "contamination" essentially captures slowly varying part of SP background.

\paragraph{Local bubble and galactic halo emission}

Hard to say what variability is like, I think, given sparse data

* Henley and Shelton (2013), XMM-Newton observations of galactic halo emission.
  over 110 sightlines
    $T ~ 2.2 x 10^6 K$
    surface brightness $\abt 0.5-7 \times 10^{-12} \unit{erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} deg^{-2}}$
* Henley and Shelton (2015), XMM and Suzaku observations of shadowing clouds
  to separate foreground (local) and background (halo) emission.

Back of the envelope calculation for our data:
background is $\abt0.1 \unit{ct/s}$ at $1 \unit{keV}$, in source region.
Effective area of MOS is $\abt400 \unit{cm^2}$...
\[
    0.1/400 ct/(s keV cm^2) ~ 2.5e-3 erg / (s erg cm^2)
\]
Angular size of sky region is $\abt 10\arcmin \times 10\arcmin \sim 0.027 \unit{deg^2}$, so we get:
\[
    1.6e-11 erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} deg^{-2}
\]
Given that this background estimate is modeled as a blend of:
local bubble + absorbed hot galactic halo emission + extragalactic power law
(we ignore the "cool" component of galactic halo, likely absorbed since
this remnant is right on galactic plane)
this seems about reasonable.  We should fall right in the range of expected
surface brightness.


Over what lengthscales does the background vary?  Or, how good is our
assumption of a uniform background, in the XMM-Newton FOV?

NOTE: there are 28 clustered observations well out of the galactic plane
that they analyze (sightlines 103.1 to 103.27; 103.8 is two observations)
SZE SurF project to complement SPT,APEX,ACT study.

    Spread in halo T is $\abt10-20\%$.  Column density variation is around 10\%.
    Angular separation between pointings is of order 0.5 degrees $\sim$ 30 arcmin..

    For this study I'm interested in (concerned with?)
    angular variations on slightly shorter scales, of ~10-20 arcmin.  I.e.,
    within a half-degree.

    But I think we are close enough -- "only" factor 2x smaller -- that this
    data might constitute decent probe!



Please also note dispute w.r.t. local bubble: Welsh and Shelton (2009,
Astrophys. and Space Sci.).

Local leo cold cloud -> constraints on local bubble emission
Snowden et al., 2015ApJ...806..119S

Some other interesting reading:
Henley, Shelton, Kwak, Hill, Mac Low (2015) 2015ApJ...800..102H
- modeling gas flow from disk to halo
Peters et al. (2015) 2015ApJ...813L..27P
- more complex modeling works out; plasma for halo emission can be sourced from
  stellar feedback

\paragraph{Solar wind charge exchange}

Solar wind charge exchange -- based on short time cut (give plots in
supplemental material) and analysis by Carter et al. (2008, 2011),
data from 0087940201 are likely unaffected.

\paragraph{Extragalactic background}

ESAS (Snowden/Kuntz) recommends alpha = 1.46 but gives no source.

Chen, Fabien, Gendreau (1997)
  ASCA/ROSAT observations of QSF3 field (RA ~ 55 deg., del ~ -44. deg.; falls
  between LMC and fornax cluster, well out of galactic plane.

  Result: photon index ~ 1.40 to 1.50, depending on how you fit it.
  Single power law fit:
    ROSAT(1-2keV) + ASCA(1-7keV) -> gamma = 1.48 +/- 0.07
    ROSAT(1-2keV) + ASCA(1-3keV) -> gamma = 1.39 +/- 0.11
  Powerlaw + raymond-smith plasma model,
    ROSAT(0.5-2keV) + ASCA(0.4-7keV) -> gamma = 1.46 +/- 0.06

Similar analysis:
Kushino et al. 2002 (PASJ), another ASCA study.

Kuntz, Snowden (200)
    ROSAT - need to skim this

Hickox, Markevitch (2006ApJ...645...95H)
    CDF-N and CDF-S (total 3 Megasec)
    [interestingly, enabled by stowed ACIS calibration observations]
    Required careful background subtraction!
      For such deep Chandra observations, unresolved sky bkg is faint compared
      to quiescent detector background.

\section{Integrated and spatially resolved spectral fits} \label{sec:spec}

Quick discussion of vpshock, vsedov fit results.
Discuss assumptions and arguments laid out by Borkowski, Lyerly, Reynolds
(2001, ApJ 548:820).
For a young-ish shock, ejecta-dominated, hot, we do expect vnei to be a good
approximation (immediate post-shock electron temperature ~ 1/2000th proton
temperature, Tau initial -> 0).
Therefore forget overly detailed modeling.

Question:
what happens if I assumed fixed (well-mixed) plasma state and attempt to infer
absorption variation?
What happens if I fix absorption and attempt to probe plasma state?

Be sure to give \textbf{qualitative} explanation of why we do not obtain high
ionization timescales -- sure, XSPEC may favor low Tau, but must what portion
of our spectrum disfavors high ionization age. (provides a stable footing from
which to make further predictions, or give a clear way to falsify our claims)

\section{Morphology}

This remnant is relatively understudied, so no previous work has actually
probed the remnant's X-ray morphology with the available archival XMM data.

Rakowski et al. found an unresolved blob blended with the bright O star.

We resolve the bulk of SNR emission to a bright blob towards the north of the
remnant (assuming that the remnant may be delineated by the MOST contours),
part of a slightly dimmer ridge arcing towards the northwest.
The south is relatively dark.

\section{Spatially resolved spectral fits}

Describe individual fits, annulus fits, etc.

We find X regions to be consistent with background (no obvious emission)

Note: for now some numbers are entered in by hand...

Main observation: nH values are generally quite high (2-3e22).

If nH is low, we can still get reasonable kT and Si/S abundances
by driving down O,Ne,Fe emission. (based on north clump fits)
IF we force solar O/Ne/Fe, lower nH (below 2) quickly starts to look
unphysical.

north clump fit is ok not amazing.
SE dark gives OK fit with both Si/S solar...

Fits with: PN power law frozen, generally Si or both Si/S thawed


Figure 6 of http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.1169v1.pdf (Hughes white paper)
where does this come from? fit of lines with approaching/receding redshifts...
strongest signal expect in center of remnant.

----> maybe could explain our spectra

Lack of H-alpha emission from Gaensler (should verify yourself).
Balmer shocks taken as evidence for progenitor NOT photo-ionizing too much
stuff.  So Balmer shocks at small radii can be taken as evidence that the
progenitor cannot have ionized "too much" stuff.
But, the absence of Balmer shocks doesn't tell us as much.
The shock could be weak, the density could be low, the material could be fully
ionized.



% TODO TODO full remnant fit could use an update, and systematic script to dump fits
