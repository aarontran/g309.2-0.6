\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

Motivations:
(1) typing remnants by ejecta,
(2) resolve ejecta spatial structure (layering, mixing),
(3) resolve interaction with surrounding medium.

We present a spatially resolved X-ray image and CCD-resolution spectra of
G309.2-0.6 based on two archived XMM-Newton observations totalling
$98 \unit{ks}$, with about half usable after flare removal.

We fit the CCD spectra of morphologically distinct regions of the remnant to
map the distribution of ejecta abundances, plasma temperature, and ionization
states.

Individual object study to build information for more ambitious global studies
of remnant properties and interaction with the ISM -- not undertaken here.
Just one piece of a puzzle.



\subsection{Previous observations of G309.2-0.6}

% Radio remnant observations and morphology
G309.2-0.6 (J2000 RA 13h46m30s, dec. $-62\arcdeg 54\arcmin 00\arcsec$) was
discovered in Molonglo $408 \unit{MHz}$ and Parkes $5000 \unit{MHz}$ surveys
\citep{day1969, clark1973, green1974, clark1975}, and has since been observed multiple
times by southern radio telescopes \citep{caswell1981, kesteven1987,
whiteoak1996, gaensler1998}.
% NOT QUITE TRUE:
% Day, Thomas, Goss (1969 Au. J. Phys. Astrophys. Suppl.)
% flagged G309.2-0.6 as a complex source, but did not identify it as a remnant
% or explore further.  Molongo/Parkes surveys may have occurred at the same
% time.  And, yes, it is confused (at the edge) with RCW 80.
\citet{gaensler1998} (hereafter, \citetalias{gaensler1998}) provide the most
comprehensive radio study to date based upon Australia Telescope Compact Array
(ATCA) $1.344 \unit{GHz}$ continuum and $1.420 \unit{GHz}$ HI observations at
angular resolution $24\arcsec$.
The radio remnant is a circular shell with two bright lobes to the NE and SW,
hereafter referred to as ``ears'' (Fig \ref{fig:snr});
the flux density at $843 \unit{MHz}$ is $6 \unit{Jy}$ \citep{whiteoak1996}.

% X-ray remnant observation(s) and morphology
X-ray emission was discovered in an Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and
Astrophysics (ASCA) survey of small remnants by \citet{rakowski2001}
(hereafter, \citetalias{rakowski2001}).
The X-ray remnant sits within the radio shell and is brightest towards the
north (Figure \ref{fig:snr}).
A faint X-ray arc on the remnant's northeast limb coincides with the radio
shell's limb and is most apparent in our $0.8$--$1.4 \unit{keV}$ band image.
Both radio ears are X-ray dark.

% Other wavelengths
The field of G309.2-0.6 has been well-observed in galactic plane surveys in
many wavelengths.
No H$\alpha$ filaments are observed (\textbf{SOURCE; give brightness bound}) % TODO
% OH maser
No $1720.5 \unit{MHz}$ OH maser emission is observed above $40 \unit{mJy}$
\citep{green1997}.
Infrared images (Spitzer IRAC 3.6,4.5,5.8,$8 \unit{{\mu}m}$, MIPSGAL, WISE)
don't show any morphological features that, by eye, could be associated with
the remnant.
% Mopra CO survey - no public data yet, in works
The remnant is not detected in GeV by Fermi-LAT \citep{acero2016} or TeV by
HESS \citep{bochow2011}.

\paragraph{Properties}

\textbf{These paragraphs could be each condensed into 1-2 sentences.}

% Galactic environment
The sight line towards G309.2-0.6 crosses the tangent of the Centaurus Arm
(variously Scu-Cen, Crux-Cen, Scu-Crux) and the near and far Carina arm at
$\abt 1.5 \unit{kpc}$ and $\abt 14 \unit{kpc}$.  Molecular and HI emission is
dominated by the Centaurus Arm at line-of-sight velocities $-70$ to
$-20 \unit{km/s}$ \citep[e.g.,][Figure 4]{dame2011}, and a good number of
molecular clouds can be identified \citep{rice2016}.  The field is populated
with unrelated but independently interesting features.

% Remnant distance in HI
The remnant distance is estimated to be within $5$--$14 \unit{kpc}$ based on HI
absorption out to the galactic rotation curve's tangent point, $v_{\mt{LSR}}
\sim -50 \unit{km/s}$, and a lack of absorption above $v_{\mt{LSR}} \sim +40
\unit{km/s}$ \citepalias{gaensler1998}.
% The galactic rotation curve is from
% \citet{fich1989} with galactic center distance $R_0 = 8.5 \unit{kpc}$ and local
% circular velocity $\Theta = 220 \unit{km/s}$.

% sigma-D estimate of distance
From the somewhat questionable $\Sigma$-$D$ relation, \citet{pavlovic2014}
provide a distance estimate of $5.9 \unit{kpc}$.
This is fraught with peril.
At least the relation of \citet{pavlovic2014} is calibrated for shell-type
radio remnants.
%See also \citet{huang1985} which presents a $\Sigma$-$D$ relation for
%shell-like remnants also interacting with clouds -- which helps constrain the
%expected brightness.
I wonder if there's some way to adjust the results based on local density
estimates, or just blindly regress against multiplicative combinations of other
salient physical variables.
Nevertheless, present the result, since it is at least partially physically
motivated.

\paragraph{Environment}

% HD 119682 - previous interest and subsequent disassociation
A bright ROSAT source (1WGA J1346.5--6255) within G309.2-0.6 is the foreground
Be star HD 119682.
The source's position within a bilobed radio remnant led
\citetalias{gaensler1998} and \citetalias{rakowski2001} to suggest that
G309.2-0.6 might be a jet- or outflow-driven remnant, similar to the SS 443 /
W50 system.
% bilobed beats bilobate on Google by 278 to 66 (cf. Google ngrams)
But, HD 119682 is likely a member of the open cluster NGC 5281 at a distance
$\abt 1.4 \unit{kpc}$, based on X-ray and optical astrometry, cluster proper
motions, and X-ray spectrum fits \citep{rakowski2006, safi-harb2007,
torrejon2013}.
% The X-ray fitted absorption of $\nH \sim 0.2 \times 10^{22} \unit{cm^{-2}}$
% is consistent with the inferred distance to HD 119682 \citep{rakowski2006,
% safi-harb2007, torrejon2013}.

% Gum 48d / RCW 80
The H II region Gum 48d (RCW 80) lies to the north of G309.2-0.6.
Gum 48d is well traced out in HI, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
emission, and warm dust; assuming these emission features all correspond to the
same H II region, the distance to Gum 48d is $\abt 3.5\unit{kpc}$, based on
ionized gas emission velocities (H$\alpha$, HI) distance estimates to the
central star system HR 5171 \citep{karr2009}.
The distance estimate to Gum 48d, in conjunction with a lack of evidence for
remnant-cloud interaction, suggest that Gum 48d is also a foreground feature
unrelated to the remnant G309.2-0.6.  The practical consequence is that we will
subsequently ignore a north-south wisp of radio emission that appears to
connect the radio remnant and H II region.

% Centaurus CO cloud
Given the remnant's rough radio and X-ray symmetry, we may be able to disfavor
a location within the Centaurus arm.  \citet{saito2001} imaged
an extensive molecular CO complex in ${}^{12}$CO, ${}^{13}$CO, and C${}^{18}$O
J=(1-0) transitions at $v_\mt{LSR} = -64$ to $-36 \unit{km/s}$.
\textbf{TODO} this would need some CO to ISM density conversion estimate so
that we could estimate a density gradient across the remnant, if it were
associated with this cloud (which we think it is not).
For this see Bolatto, Wolfire and Leroy (2013).
It is clear that remnants expanding into a density gradient need not look that
asymmetric \citep{williams2013}, so \textbf{this is speculative and may be
outright wrong}.
But, I think we can start thinking about what kind of environments may be
relevant for this remnant's evolution.
% H II region = blob of natal stardust, shoved out and compressed by
% young OB star's radiation pressure, interacting with ambient ISM, nearby
% stars and clouds, etc...
%
% Here's a lovely optical photograph, clearly showing the bright H II region and
% the bluer star cluster NGC 5281 to the south:
% https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RCW_80.jpg

% Mopra CO J(1-0) survey, resolution 30 arcsec and 0.1 km/s, would be huge!
% Looking at our crude rotation curve -- beyond tangent point, 100 km/s per 10kpc
% is the approximate slope; 0.1 km/s means we have a distance resolution of order
% 10 parsecs, comparable to or smaller than this remnant size.
% Compare, Dame survey has beamwidth ~ 1/8 deg. = 7.5 arcmin = 450 arcsec

% ATCA data -- cannot access at http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/HI/sgps/queryForm.html
% SGPS survey -- taken 1998-2000.
% Emailed a feedback query on 2016 April 13... probably won't have much luck.

% TODO: check out ATCA J134649--625235, mentioned in Gaensler

% Summary / wrap-up
\citetalias{gaensler1998} and \citetalias{rakowski2001} have given the most
comprehensive radio and X-ray imaging studies of G309.2-0.6 to date.
Here, we study the spatially resolved X-ray remnant using archived XMM-Newton
observations.

\section{Observations and Data Reduction} \label{sec:obs}

XMM-Newton observed G309.2-0.6 for $97.7 \unit{ks}$ in two pointings
(Table~\ref{tab:obs}), which we hereafter reference by year.
The 2009 observation targeted the Be star HD 119682, but also captured
G309.2-0.6 on the MOS1/2 and PN detectors.
After background flare filtering, our good exposure times are $47 \unit{ks}$
for MOS1/2 and $27 \unit{ks}$ for PN.

% More verbose version
%XMM-Newton has observed G309.2-0.6 for $97.73 \unit{ks}$ in two pointings.
%Obsid 0087940201 (PI J. P. Hughes) was $40.46 \unit{ks}$ on 2001 August 28
%with MOS1/2 in Full Frame mode, PN in Extended Full Frame mode, and XMM's
%``thick'' optical filter.
%Obsid 0551000201 (PI C. Motch) was $57.27 \unit{ks}$ on 2009 March 6--7
%with MOS1/2 in Full Frame mode, PN in Large Window mode, and XMM's ``medium''
%optical filter.
%The Motch pointing targeted the foreground Be star HD 119682, but also

% Event lists, soft proton light curve filtering
We reduce the data with XMM's Science Analysis System (SAS) v15.0.0 and
Extended Science Analysis System (ESAS) v5.9 \citep{snowden2008, kuntz2008}.
\footnote{\href{http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xmm/esas/cookbook/xmm-esas.html}{http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xmm/esas/cookbook/xmm-esas.html}}
Event lists are created with SAS tasks \texttt{emchain} and \texttt{epchain}
(with \texttt{epchain} run twice to generate out-of-time events).
% TODO shorten emchain/epchain sentence
Strong soft proton flares are filtered by ESAS tasks \texttt{mos-filter} and
\texttt{pn-filter}, which fit a Gaussian to a histogram of time-binned count
rates for each exposure and discard time intervals where the count rate is
$1.5\sigma$ above the fitted Gaussian mean.  % TODO - sentence needs retooling
We further inspect the $2.5$--$12 \unit{keV}$ field-of-view light curves and
manually cut some brief good-time intervals surrounded by higher count rate
flares.
About half to two-thirds of each observation is lost to flares, with more
severe loss for PN exposures.
The resulting live times (good time intervals less CCD readout time) are
given in Table~\ref{tab:obs}.

% Point sources
We remove point sources with the ESAS task \texttt{cheese}.
\textbf{TODO: merge pt source removal lists from both obsids}  %TODO
Of note, HD 119682 requires an exclusion mask $\sim 1\arcmin$ in radius.

% CCD exclusions
In obs. ID 0551000201, we excluded two MOS CCDs and the entire PN exposure from
our spectral analysis.
MOS2 CCD5 showed anomalously high soft X-ray background noise in its corner
counts \citep[cf.][]{kuntz2008}; MOS1 CCD6 was disabled by a presumed
micrometeorite in 2005.
The PN in Large Window mode does not collect corner counts, so we are unable to
estimate the detector background from ESAS tasks; moreover, the good time is
$\lesssim 10\%$ of our available exposures due to severe flare contamination.
We do include these PN counts in our non-background-subtracted broad- and
narrow-band images.


\subsection{Spectrum Extraction and Modeling}

% Spectrum and QPB creation
Spectra are created from ``good'' single and double events (i.e.,
\texttt{PATTERN} $\leq 12,4$ for MOS, PN respectively; \texttt{FLAG} $= 0$ for
both MOS and PN), using ESAS tasks \texttt{\{mos,pn\}-spectra}.
We fit all spectra in XSPEC 12.9.0d \citep{arnaud1996}
using the T{\"u}bingen-Boulder ISM elemental abundances \citep{wilms2000}.
Our absorption model is \texttt{tbnew} v2.3.2
\footnote{http://pulsar.sternwarte.uni-erlangen.de/wilms/research/tbabs/},
which is the latest version of the gas absorption model discussed by
\citet{wilms2000}.

% QPB
The detector background is modeled by ESAS tasks \texttt{\{mos,pn\}\_back}
by (1) computing a quiescent spectrum from unexposed CCD corner counts,
(2) augmenting the quiescent spectrum with corner counts from public
observations with similar count rates and spectral hardness, and (3) scaling
the augmented quiescent spectrum shape to that expected for the source region
of interest, using the ratio of quiescent spectra across corner / source
regions from XMM's filter wheel closed observations and assuming that the ratio
of spectra across a given MOS or PN chip is time invariant.
See Sec. 3.4 of \citet{kuntz2008} for more detail and motivation.
% TODO this needs to be shortened.
% but I want to make clear that this is a somewhat ad hoc model

% Instrumental lines
We model instrumental lines as zero-width, fixed-energy Gaussians and assume
that relative line strengths (i.e., line ratios) in a given CCD region are time
invariant, or, the same between FWC and observation data.
In spectrum fits, we use line normalizations from FWC data and vary a constant
prefactor for all instrumental lines in a given exposure.
For MOS exposures, we fit FWC spectra to two Gaussian lines at $1.49$ (Al) and
$1.75 \unit{keV}$ (Si) with a broken power-law continuum.
For PN, we fit seven Gaussian lines at $1.49$ (Al), $4.54$ (Ti), $5.44$ (Cr),
$7.49$ (Ni), $8.05$ (Cu), $8.62$ (Zn), and $8.90 \unit{keV}$ (Cu K-beta) with a
broken power-law continuum.
The PN Ti and Cr lines do not contribute significantly to observation spectra,
but are clearly visible in FWC spectra.

% SWCX
We neglect solar wind charge exchange (SWCX) emission, which affects a subset
of XMM-Newton observations \citep{snowden2004}.
The 2001 observation was not flagged by \citet{carter2011} as
containing time-variable soft X-ray emission indicative of exospheric SWCX,
% TODO what is the difference between these types of swcx?
Magnetospheric SWCX emissivity can be estimated by combining a magnetosphere
model \citep{spreiter1966} with Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) solar wind
velocity and density measurements, implemented via an online tool by the United
States XMM-Newton Guest Observer Facility (XMM GOF).
\footnote{\href{https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xmm/scripts/xmm_trend.html}{https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xmm/scripts/xmm\_trend.html}}
\textbf{TODO find better reference?}  % TODO revise text, too
During the Hughes observation, modeled SWCX emission decreases by a
factor of $10$.
We extracted 0087940201 MOS1 remnant spectra early and late in the observation
and, by eye, saw no obvious differences in soft X-ray emission.
% TODO I will be re-doing this.
The XMM GOF magnetosphere model additionally predicts weaker SWCX emission for
0551000201 compared to 0087940201.
We thus argue that SWCX can safely be neglected in both observations.
% TODO reword, too verbose

% NOTE: see my notes from 2016 Jan 13 on spectrum cuts to evaluate SWCX
% 0551000201 was observed March 2009
%   Carter/Sembay analysis performed August 2009, so 0551000201 was likely
%   still in its proprietary period
% 0087940201 is not listed in Carter/Sembay, but meets basic selection criteria
% (namely, MOS1/MOS2 operating in full frame mode

% Residual soft proton contamination
Residual soft protons dominate the X-ray background above $\sim 3 \unit{keV}$
and are not removed by flare filtering due to their slow time variation.
We model residual soft protons by a power law that bypasses CCD response and
effective area functions, following the ESAS prescription.
%% Background not really needed
% Spectra plotted in channel space show a constant count rate signal in the
% highest energy bins that clearly cannot be modeled by any astrophysical source
% -- a power law with index 0, folded through the effective area, falls off far
% too rapidly to account for the observed signal.
% The near constant nature of the noise is consistent with detector noise induced
% by soft proton interaction.

% Introduce -- joint source + background fit, source model, regions & spectra
We jointly fit spectra from source (0--400\arcsec) and background
(510--700\arcsec) regions centered on the remnant (Figure~\ref{fig:regions}).
We model the integrated remnant as a single temperature, non-equilibrium
ionization (NEI) plasma (XSPEC model \texttt{tbabs\_new * vnei}, after
\citet{hamilton1983}).  % Better reference, phrasing?
Our X-ray sky background model comprises an unabsorbed local bubble thermal
plasma, an absorbed galactic halo thermal plasma, and an absorbed extragalactic
background power law (XSPEC model \texttt{apec + tbnew\_gas*(apec + powerlaw)}).
We allow the background plasma temperatures and absorbing column to vary, but
fix the extragalactic power law to photon index $1.4$ and normalization
$10.9 \unit{cm^{-2}\, s^{-1}\, sr^{-1}\, keV^{-1}}$ \citep{hickox2006}.
The fitted model components, with representative source and background spectra,
are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:src-bkg-fits}.

Our galactic halo emission fit has temperature $\abt 2\times$ and emission
measure $\abt 10$--$100\times$ larger than those inferred from high galactic
latitude XMM pointings outside the galactic plane \citep{henley2013}.
From extremely crude estimates, assuming halo density $\propto r^{-3/2}$ and an
average sight-line length $1/2\times$ ours through the galactic disk, we might
expect a factor of $8$--$10$ increase in emission measure in our observation.
It is possible that there is tension between our fitted local bubble
and halo parameters and more thorough measurements, but we qualitatively
suggest that degeneracy in our fits (especially with soft proton contamination)
limits our ability to constrain X-ray background parameters further.

% We don't care
Constraints on X-ray background parameters are beyond the scope of
this study; an inaccurate background model may be obscured by the free soft
proton power law parameters in any case.
Our conclusions are largely consistent with ASCA data analysis by
\citet{rakowski2001}, except that we find significantly higher absorption
which may be affected by inaccurate background modeling.

that parameters are reasonable.

\subsection{Annuli spectra}

% Procedure, results
We extract and fit spectra from $100\arcsec$ wide annuli centered on the
remnant to discern how thermal plasma emission varies with remnant radius
(Figure~\ref{fig:regions}).
Each annulus is modeled by an absorbed NEI plasma
(XSPEC model \texttt{tbabs\_new * vnei}) with absorption column tied across
all annuli.
The X-ray background is fixed to the integrated remnant fit model
(Table~\ref{tab:src-fit}).
We neglect redistribution of counts between annuli due to point spread function
(PSF) wings as the half-energy-enclosed width $\abt10$--$20\arcsec$ is much
smaller than our annuli widths.
Annulus spectra from $0$--$500\arcsec$ are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:annuli-spectra}, and fit parameters for the interior four
annuli are in Table~\ref{tab:annulus-fit}.
The best fit absorption (not tabulated) is $2.11^{+0.04}_{-0.07} \nHUnits$.

% outer annulus handling
The outer annulus fit ($400$--$500\arcsec$) was very poorly constrained;
two fit with slightly different X-ray background parameters, which agreed
within error, yielded wildly divergent fits ($kT = 0.6$ vs. $10 \unit{keV}$,
Si and S abundances $\abt10$ vs. $\abt2$,
ionization timescale $\tau = 1 \times 10^{10}$ vs. $5 \times 10^{13} \TauUnits$).
Discarding the outer annulus has no impact on fits to interior annuli, so our
subsequent fits and analysis consider only four annuli.
But, a few figures and tables include results from fits to all five annuli for
comparison \textbf{TODO: remove eventually}.
Some Si and S line emission is clearly required without too much underlying
bremsstrahlung continuum.

% center "annulus" handling
The remnant center ($0$--$100\arcsec$) shows excess soft X-rays
($<1 \unit{keV}$) compared to our NEI model.
In Table~\ref{tab:annulus-varycenter}, we attempt to explain the central excess
by allowing sub- or super-ISM O, Ne, and Fe abundances
Although additional elements improve the fit, it is not clear that a particular
combination of abundances can fully explain the model discrepancy.
Significant O line emission can be produced by SWCX, but the absence of soft
X-ray excess outside the central region disfavors this explanation (as we would
expect SWCX to fill the field of view).

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Assumptions and prior work}

% probably can omit or place one sentence elsewhere
\textbf{standard vnei disclaimer}
The single temperature and ionization age \texttt{vnei} model ignores spatial
structure in temperature, ionization, and ejecta abundances.
Nevertheless, it fits the remnant reasonably well, consistent with the
subsequent annulus fits yielding ionization timescales and temperatures varying
by $\abt50\%$ at most (Table~\ref{tab:annulus-fit}).

% Discussion: alternative models unnecessary.  TODO revisit, re-run these fits
%We also fit to \texttt{vpshock} and \texttt{vsedov} models, which integrate
%emission over an assumed plane shock or Sedov geometry \citep{borkowski2001},
%but find no significant difference in fitted plasma parameters, expected given
%fitted electron temperatures of order $1 \unit{keV}$ \citep{borkowski2001}.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% The \texttt{vpshock} fit converges to $\tau_{\mt{l}} \sim 0$
% Discuss assumptions and arguments laid out by Borkowski, Lyerly, Reynolds
% (2001, ApJ 548:820).
% For a young-ish shock, ejecta-dominated, hot, we do expect vnei to be a good
% approximation (immediate post-shock electron temperature ~ 1/2000th proton
% temperature, Tau initial -> 0).
% Therefore forget overly detailed modeling.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Takeaway point from Borkowski+ 2001:
%   vpshock is a better approx to full Sedov solution than vnei model
%   at high electron temperatures (order ~ a few keV)
% BUT, at x-ray photon energies > ~ 0.5 keV, difference is very small.
% so vnei is not that bad.
% ...
% why do all these plots have emission measure on the x-axis?
    % See Sec. 3.3 of borkowski 2001 for vpshock model


Our fitted absorption column and ionization timescales disagree with prior
X-ray fits.
\citet{rakowski2001} obtain $\nH = (0.7 \pm 0.3) \nHUnits$,
$\kB T = 2.0^{+1.0}_{-0.6}$, and
$\tau = 1.5^{+4.7}_{-0.6} \times 10^{11} \unit{s\;cm^{-3}}$
from an absorbed NEI model for ASCA data with enhanced Ne, Mg, Si, S, Ar, Ca,
Fe abundances; the best fit converged towards a pure metal plasma
(H, He $\to 0$), and taking abundances relative to Si they favored
under-abundant Ne, Mg, Ar relative to S.
\citet{safi-harb2007} report $N_H = 0.65^{+0.45}_{-0.25} \nHUnits$.
and $\kB T = 2 \pm 0.6 \unit{keV}$ without providing $\tau$, from
an absorbed NEI model for the 2001 XMM data with
super-ISM Si, S and sub-ISM O, Ne, Mg, Ca, Fe.

The relative abundances $[Mg/Si] = 0.23^{+0.09}_{0.08}$ and $[S/Si] =
1.09^{+0.24}_{-0.18}$ from \citet{rakowski2001} are consistent with our fits
($0.29 \pm 0.03$ and $0.93 \pm 0.12$ respectively).  Similarly, the Si, S, Mg
abundances of \citet{safi-harb2007} are consistent with our
findings.

\citet{rakowski2001} report emission measure
$(4\pi D^2)^{-1} \int n_e n_H dV = 9.7^{+200}_{-9.7} \times 10^8$, much smaller
than our $\abt 4 \times 10^{11} \unit{cm^{-5}}$; their inferred hydrogen
density is therefore $10\times$ smaller.
The low value is partially offset by the extreme ($\abt 30\times$) abundances
inferred by \citet{rakowski2001}, and the lack of constraint on bremsstrahlung
continuum as their fit favored a pure metal plasma.

The discrepant absorption and ionization timescale could arise from degeneracy
with respect to absorption, ionization time, and total metallicity (H
abundance), particularly as \citet{rakowski2001} had to explicitly model point
source contamination from HD 119682, which dominates
below $\abt 1 \unit{keV}$ and above $\abt 3$--$4 \unit{keV}$.
The XMM data fit by \citet{safi-harb2007} should be free of HD 119682
contamination, but we cannot speak to the absorption discrepancy without
knowledge of their background and instrumental line modeling and the fitted
ionization timescale.
Although our fits are limited by soft proton contamination at high and
low energy ranges as well, XMM's spatial and spectral resolution allow us to
excise point source emission and better constrain the bremsstrahlung continuum.

More simply, free abundances of O, Ne, Mg, Ar, Ca, and Fe may suffice to
explain the very different absorption numbers.
Under-abundant O, Ne, Fe

% Discussion: nH value discrepancies (TODO revisit these calculations)
Our fitted absorption column density is higher than that computed from HI and
dust maps.
For G309.2-0.6, the \textit{Swift} galactic $\nH$ calculator implementation of
\citet{willingale2013} provides an expected column density $1.81 \nHUnits$.
Dust scattering can bias X-ray spectrum fits for a purely absorbing column
$\abt25\%$ its true value \citep{corrales2016}, although
some scattered light is recaptured in our extended source region spectra.
The \textit{spectrum fit value} of $\nH$ may also be estimated from empirical
linear regression against optical extinction $\AV$ \citep[e.g.,][]{foight2016}
-- which benefits from a strong sampling of sources within the galactic plane,
and empirical validation -- but does not offer physical insight into the
discrepancy. We find approximate agreement ($2$--$3 \nHUnits$) with the various
relations.
\textbf{TODO: for now detailed accounting of absorption is beyond the scope of
this work}

The absence of H$\alpha$ emission is unilluminating.
Assuming H$\alpha$ emission to arise by shock propagation through ISM
containing neutral hydrogen \citep{chevalier1978},  % 1978ApJ...225L..27C
any of the following factors may contribute: low density of neutral H due to
progenitor or supernova ionization, low ambient ISM density, or some local
conditions (extremely high post-shock density?) that rapidly ionize neutral H,
preventing Balmer line emission.
Or, the available imagery may just not be deep enough.

\subsection{Morphology}

% Discuss morphology in broad terms
The broadband $0.8$--$3.3 \unit{keV}$ remnant mostly fills the radio remnant,
excepting the remnant's southeast limb and edges of the radio ears
(Figures~\ref{fig:snr}).
X-ray emission is concentrated at and behind the northwest limb, which is
somewhat dimmer in radio compared to the southeast limb and ears.

% Spatial distribution of line emission
The line emission broadly follows the broadband emission (particularly the
dominant Si line), but Mg and S appear to be localized to the north and east
(Figure~\ref{fig:rgb}).
Both Si and S are concentrated in the northern clump (\textbf{TODO:
green-band Si image is overexposed, obscuring detail}), although Si more
visibly fills the remnant.
Mg, in comparison, appears localized to a large northwestern clump and possibly
some towards the southeast X-ray limb, although the significance of this
apparent spatial enhancement is questionable.

\subsection{A young remnant}

% Radial variation in kT and Tau
The plasma temperature and ionization timescale vary across annuli, even with
our coarse radial binning (Figure~\ref{fig:kt-tau-radius}).
The center and limb plasma is hotter and more recently shocked than the bright
$200$--$300\arcsec$ annulus.
These variations are small and of order $20$--$50\%$, and may be meaningless in
light of errors from systematic assumptions.
But, these variations are consistent with the standard picture of supernova
remnant acceleration, wherein we expect recently shocked ISM and central
reverse-shocked central ejecta to be the ``youngest'' emitting plasma.

\begin{figure*}[!ht]
    \plottwo{fig/fig_kt_radius.pdf}{fig/fig_tau_radius.pdf}
    \figcaption{Electron temperature (left) and ionization timescale (right)
        as a function of radius from annuli spectra fit
        (Tables~\ref{tab:annulus-fit}, \ref{tab:annulus-varycenter}).}
    \label{fig:kt-tau-radius}
\end{figure*}

% Emission measure derived masses
We estimate X-ray emitting plasma mass and density from the integrated remnant
fit emission measure (Table~\ref{tab:src-fit}).
Assuming that the plasma fills a spherical volume of radius $400\arcsec$,
\[
    \nH = 0.11 f^{-1/2} d_{5}^{-1/2} \unit{cm^{-3}}
\]
with volume filling factor $f \in [0,1]$ and distance relative to $5
\unit{kpc}$ as $d_{5}$.
We then estimate mass $M = 1.4 \nH m_{H} f V$, following \citet{auchettl2015},
as:
\[
    M = 10.3 M_{\sun} f^{1/2} d_{5}^{5/2}
\]
with corresponding ejecta masses $0.016 M_{\sun}$ of silicon, $0.011 M_{\sun}$
of sulfur, and $0.005 M_{\sun}$ of magnesium.
% TODO provide stat uncertainty from XSPEC
As ejecta abundances for Mg, Si, S are not as strongly variable between Ia and
core-collapse nucleosynthesis yields (versus O or Fe), the relative abundances
of these elements do not clearly constrain the progenitor type.
\textbf{TODO: read more about Ia and CC models and their yields.}


The high electron temperature, low ionization age, enhanced ejecta abundances,
low emitting plasma mass all point towards a dynamically young remnant.
The shock velocity derived from the outer ($300$--$400\arcsec$) annulus
electron temperature is $1000$--$50,000 \unit{km/s}$ depending on the assumed
extent of electron-proton equilibration.
The age inferred from the emitting plasma norm and integrated ionization age
$1.75 \TauUnits$ is $5000 f^{1/2} d_{5}^{1/2} \unit{yr}$.
Enhanced central Si and S emission suggests that the reverse shock has
traversed most of the remnant.

There is significant tension with respect to the expected Sedov-model physical
size and age.

The ionization age and temperature suggest that G309 is a few kyr old.
But, the Sedov age for a $6\arcmin$ radius at $d_{5} = 1$ and $E_{51} = 1$ is
$24000 \unit{yr}$!

This would be resolved if our absorption is much lower than what I'm getting,
in fact.

G309 is somewhat center-filled in X-rays and clearly shell-like in radio,
consistent with the definition of a mixed-morphology (MM) remnant
\citep{rho1998}.
But, the plasma is relatively hot and recently shocked for a MM remnant, and
the surface brightness peaks off-center.
The remnant's age estimates, fitted X-ray plasma parameters and brightness
distribution are all consistent with an ejecta-dominated young remnant, which
does not require complex cloud or thermal conduction models as proposed for MM
remnants.

% NOTE: SW lobe and ridge both show weird shifts in PN spectral lines (Si, S)
% (this dates from Jan/Feb -- to be investigated with now up to date procedures)

\subsection{Friends of young remnants}

A comparative study could be interesting.
G352.7-0.1 (Pannuti+ 2014 2014ApJ...782..102P, XMM/Chandra) appears very
similar: we see a radio shell, somewhat center-filled X-rays (but not quite),
and more ejecta emission than would be expected for its age.

\section{Conclusions}

TBD

\section{Misc}

Questions for self-edification (many things I don't understand):
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the characteristic cooling timescale (adiabatic expansion?)
        for reverse shock heated ejecta?
        Under what conditions (density, turbulent mixing, ...)
        would conduction or other energy transfer processes play a role?
    \item What is the state of modeling for young remnant evolution?
        Could I fire up CR-Hydro-NEI or some other simple 1-D model,
        obtain densities, ionization times, temperature as a function of
        radius, and construct model remnant images?
        YES: Ferrand+ 2014 show lovely 3D images (don't trace reverse shock all
        the way).
        Lee+ 2014 for CR Hydro NEI
        These are probably the best starting points.

\section{Solar wind charge exchange checks}

% TODO explain why we don't care about this
We also neglect low-level solar wind charge exchange (SWCX) contamination,
which may also vary between the two widely-separated XMM pointings.


\section{Sky X-ray background modeling caveats}

The sky X-ray background may not be constant over scales of several arcminutes.
\citet{henley2013} modeled galactic halo emission using 110 XMM-Newton
observations well outside the galactic plane.
Most of their observations were widely separated, but a group of pointings
within $\abt 30\arcmin$ (labeled 103.1--103.27) showed halo temperature
variations $\abt 10$--$20\%$ and emission measure variation within a factor of
$\abt 2$.
% TODO I am totally just eyeballing the numbers right now -- not that useful.
% Possibly remove this.
% Henley 2013: looking at 28 clustered observations well out of the galactic
% plane, sightlines 103.1 to 103.27; 103.8 is two observations.
% SZE SurF project to complement SPT,APEX,ACT study.
Taking background from an annulus around the remnant should average out some
variation, although without knowing the power spectrum, we cannot say anything
quantitative.

The X-ray background parameters from our integrated source and background fit
may be biased by our assumption that a single-temperature NEI plasma adequately
describes integrated remnant emission.
To check this, we fit the background annulus alone, which removes this possible
bias but sacrifices background counts embedded in the source spectrum.
The resulting X-ray background parameters agree within error.

\section{Is a nonthermal component compatible with integrated remnant fits?}

% Random question: should nonthermal be hyphenated (non-thermal) or not?
We do not detect nonthermal (power-law-like) X-ray emission.
By eye, we estimate that nonthermal soft X-rays must be less than $\abt 10\%$
of the thermal continuum.

Fits with a single nonthermal component (XSPEC \texttt{powerlaw} or
\texttt{srcut}) limit nonthermal emission to, qualitatively, less than 10\% of
the contribution from thermal emission \citep[cf.][]{reynolds1999}.
Figure~\ref{fig:nonthermal} shows the best fit nonthermal contributions for
each model.
For a power law, we obtain photon index $\Gamma = 4.5 \pm 1$ with
normalization $1.4^{+1.1}_{-0.09} \times 10^{-3} \unit{photons\;s^{-1}\;cm^{-2}\;keV^{-1}}$
at $1 \unit{keV}$.
For \texttt{srcut}, we obtain break frequency $10^{15.7 \pm 0.1}$
corresponding to photon energy cut-off $\abt 0.02 \unit{keV}$.
% Source: 20160630_src_srcutlog_nonsolar_snr_src.txt

Note: the radio spectral index is $0.53$ as derived by \citet{gaensler1998}.
His calculation ignores single dish measurements on the basis that the flux
is confused with RCW 80 emission.  Some authors made efforts to correct their
flux measurements for the confusion; if we include Parkes single dish
measurements the radio index decreases to $0.36 \pm 0.11$.
My own fit obtains $0.52 \pm 0.09$, marginally different than that of
\citet{gaensler1998}, but for simplicity and consistency just use their values.

I also fit the outer annulus emission with a nonthermal component, but the
(rather questionable) fit allowed no nonthermal emission at all.
Given that the supernova remnant's thermal emission is already ill-constrained,
this is not surprising.
I could re-attempt this with a $350$--$450\arcsec$ annulus instead of
$400$--$500\arcsec$.  % TODO - investigate this.

\section{Does fitting four versus five annuli make any difference?}

Answer: no, parameters are identical within error (and the change in parameter
values is much smaller than error).
This is already shown in Table~\ref{tab:annulus-varycenter}.
For thoroughness, I give fit parameters from ``stock'' fits (only Si and S
free for each annulus) in Tables~\ref{tab:fiveann-stock} and
\ref{tab:fourann-stock}.

I also verified by eye that
(1) all instrumental line normalizations agree to $<1\%$ (often $\lesssim0.1\%$),
(2) remnant model norms agree to $\lesssim 1$\%,
(3) soft proton norms and indices agree to $\lesssim 1\%$.

In short, we are good to go.

\section{Frequently asked questions (or, nitpickables)}

Here are caveats, disclaimers, and possible points of contention that are not
discussed in the main text for brevity, but should be itemized and reviewed.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Why are we using Chandra-derived extragalactic X-ray background
        parameters instead of XMM-derived parameters?}
        Simply, I am more inclined to trust Chandra background modeling and
        background subtraction.
        The \citet{hickox2006} values agree to $\abt 10\%$ of values derived
        from \textit{XMM-Newton}, \textit{Swift}, \textit{ASCA}, and
        \textit{ROSAT} studies
        \citep{chen1997, kushino2002, de-luca2004, moretti2009}.
        \textbf{Do we need to adjust the normalization because XMM resolves
        fewer extragalactic sources than Chandra?}
        If I recall correctly from previous reading (forgot which source(s)) --
        small-number statistics prevail, so a few point sources removed don't
        matter.  It could be more significant for wide-field studies?
    \item \textbf{Why are halo emission and extragalactic background subject to
        the same absorption?}
        Yes, this is unrealistic.  Halo emission should be absorbed by some
        distance-and-density-averaged column, whereas the extragalactic
        background is attenuated by the complete galactic column.
        But, our X-ray background is decently well fit by our current model,
        and we don't see any need to introduce more parameters.
        The absorptions would only differ by a factor of $\abt 2$ for each
        component, and the discrepancy might be folded into unabsorbed local
        emission or the soft proton components.
        However we have not explored this in depth, and it is possible that our
        assessment of the background would change.
\end{itemize}
