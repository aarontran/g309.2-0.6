\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

Motivations:
(1) typing remnants by ejecta,
(2) resolve ejecta spatial structure (layering, mixing),
(3) resolve interaction with surrounding medium

Individual object study to build information for more ambitious global studies
of remnant properties and interaction with the ISM -- not undertaken here.
Just one piece of a puzzle.

We present a spatially resolved X-ray image and localized CCD-resolution
spectra of G309.2-0.6 based on two archival XMM-Newton observations.
We fit the CCD spectra of morphologically distinct regions of the remnant to
map the distribution of ejecta abundances, plasma temperature, and ionization
states.


\subsection{Previous observations of G309.2-0.6}

% Radio remnant observations and morphology
G309.2-0.6 (J2000 RA 13h46m30s, dec. $-62\arcdeg 54\arcmin 00\arcsec$) was
discovered in Molonglo $408 \unit{MHz}$ and Parkes $5000 \unit{MHz}$ surveys
\citep{day1969, clark1973, green1974, clark1975}, and has since been observed multiple
times by southern radio telescopes \citep{caswell1981, kesteven1987,
whiteoak1996, gaensler1998}.
% NOT QUITE TRUE:
% Day, Thomas, Goss (1969 Au. J. Phys. Astrophys. Suppl.)
% flagged G309.2-0.6 as a complex source, but did not identify it as a remnant
% or explore further.  Molongo/Parkes surveys may have occurred at the same
% time.  And, yes, it is confused (at the edge) with RCW 80.
\citet{gaensler1998} (hereafter, \citetalias{gaensler1998}) provide the most
comprehensive radio study to date based upon Australia Telescope Compact Array
(ATCA) $1.344 \unit{GHz}$ continuum and $1.420 \unit{GHz}$ HI observations at
angular resolution $24\arcsec$.
The radio remnant is a circular shell with two bright lobes to the NE and SW,
hereafter referred to as ``ears'' (Fig \ref{fig:snr});
the flux density at $843 \unit{MHz}$ is $6 \unit{Jy}$ \citep{whiteoak1996}.

% X-ray remnant observation(s) and morphology
X-ray emission was discovered in an Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and
Astrophysics (ASCA) survey of small remnants by \citet{rakowski2001}
(hereafter, \citetalias{rakowski2001}).
The X-ray remnant sits within the radio shell and is brightest towards the
north (Figure \ref{fig:snr}).
A faint X-ray arc on the remnant's northeast limb coincides with the radio
shell's limb and is most apparent in our $0.8$--$1.4 \unit{keV}$ band image.
Both radio ears are X-ray dark.

% Other wavelengths
The field of G309.2-0.6 has been well-observed in galactic plane surveys in
many wavelengths.
No H$\alpha$ filaments are observed (\textbf{SOURCE; give brightness bound}) % TODO
% OH maser
No $1720.5 \unit{MHz}$ OH maser emission is observed above $40 \unit{mJy}$
\citep{green1997}.
Infrared images (Spitzer IRAC 3.6,4.5,5.8,$8 \unit{{\mu}m}$, MIPSGAL, WISE)
don't show any morphological features that, by eye, could be associated with
the remnant.
% Mopra CO survey - no public data yet, in works

\paragraph{Properties}

\textbf{These paragraphs could be each condensed into 1-2 sentences.}

% Galactic environment
The sight line towards G309.2-0.6 crosses the tangent of the Centaurus Arm
(variously Scu-Cen, Crux-Cen, Scu-Crux) and the near and far Carina arm at
$\abt 1.5 \unit{kpc}$ and $\abt 14 \unit{kpc}$.  Molecular and HI emission is
dominated by the Centaurus Arm at line-of-sight velocities $-70$ to
$-20 \unit{km/s}$ \citep[e.g.,][Figure 4]{dame2011}, and a good number of
molecular clouds can be identified \citep{rice2016}.  The field is populated
with unrelated but independently interesting features.

% Remnant distance in HI
The remnant distance is estimated to be within $5$--$14 \unit{kpc}$ based on HI
absorption out to the galactic rotation curve's tangent point, $v_{\mt{LSR}}
\sim -50 \unit{km/s}$, and a lack of absorption above $v_{\mt{LSR}} \sim +40
\unit{km/s}$ \citepalias{gaensler1998}.  The galactic rotation curve is from
\citet{fich1989} with galactic center distance $R_0 = 8.5 \unit{kpc}$ and local
circular velocity $\Theta = 220 \unit{km/s}$.

% sigma-D estimate of distance
From the somewhat questionable $\Sigma$-$D$ relation, \citet{pavlovic2014}
provide a distance estimate of $5.9 \unit{kpc}$.
This is fraught with peril.
At least the relation of \citet{pavlovic2014} is calibrated for shell-type
radio remnants.
%See also \citet{huang1985} which presents a $\Sigma$-$D$ relation for
%shell-like remnants also interacting with clouds -- which helps constrain the
%expected brightness.
I wonder if there's some way to adjust the results based on local density
estimates, or just blindly regress against multiplicative combinations of other
salient physical variables.
Nevertheless, present the result, since it is at least partially physically
motivated.

\paragraph{Environment}

% HD 119682 - previous interest and subsequent disassociation
A bright ROSAT source (1WGA J1346.5--6255) within G309.2-0.6 is the foreground
Be star HD 119682.
The source's position within a bilobed radio remnant led
\citetalias{gaensler1998} and \citetalias{rakowski2001} to suggest that
G309.2-0.6 might be a jet- or outflow-driven remnant, similar to the SS 443 /
W50 system.
% bilobed beats bilobate on Google by 278 to 66 (cf. Google ngrams)
But, HD 119682 is likely a member of the open cluster NGC 5281 at a distance
$\abt 1.4 \unit{kpc}$, based on X-ray and optical astrometry, cluster proper
motions, and X-ray spectrum fits \citep{rakowski2006, safi-harb2007,
torrejon2013}.
% The X-ray fitted absorption of $\nH \sim 0.2 \times 10^{22} \unit{cm^{-2}}$
% is consistent with the inferred distance to HD 119682 \citep{rakowski2006,
% safi-harb2007, torrejon2013}.

% Gum 48d / RCW 80
The H II region Gum 48d (RCW 80) lies to the north of G309.2-0.6.
Gum 48d is well traced out in HI, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
emission, and warm dust; assuming these emission features all correspond to the
same H II region, the distance to Gum 48d is $\abt 3.5\unit{kpc}$, based on
ionized gas emission velocities (H$\alpha$, HI) distance estimates to the
central star system HR 5171 \citep{karr2009}.
The distance estimate to Gum 48d, in conjunction with a lack of evidence for
remnant-cloud interaction, suggest that Gum 48d is also a foreground feature
unrelated to the remnant G309.2-0.6.  The practical consequence is that we will
subsequently ignore a north-south wisp of radio emission that appears to
connect the radio remnant and H II region.

% Centaurus CO cloud
Given the remnant's rough radio and X-ray symmetry, we may be able to disfavor
a location within the Centaurus arm.  \citet{saito2001} imaged
an extensive molecular CO complex in ${}^{12}$CO, ${}^{13}$CO, and C${}^{18}$O
J=(1-0) transitions at line-of-sight velocities $-64$ to $-36 \unit{km/s}$.
\textbf{TODO} this would need some CO to ISM density conversion estimate so
that we could estimate a density gradient across the remnant, if it were
associated with this cloud (which we think it is not).
For this see Bolatto, Wolfire and Leroy (2013).
It is clear that remnants expanding into a density gradient need not look that
asymmetric \citep{williams2013}, so \textbf{this is speculative and may be
outright wrong}.
But, I think we can start thinking about what kind of environments may be
relevant for this remnant's evolution.
% H II region = blob of natal stardust, shoved out and compressed by
% young OB star's radiation pressure, interacting with ambient ISM, nearby
% stars and clouds, etc...
%
% Here's a lovely optical photograph, clearly showing the bright H II region and
% the bluer star cluster NGC 5281 to the south:
% https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RCW_80.jpg

% Mopra CO J(1-0) survey, resolution 30 arcsec and 0.1 km/s, would be huge!
% Looking at our crude rotation curve -- beyond tangent point, 100 km/s per 10kpc
% is the approximate slope; 0.1 km/s means we have a distance resolution of order
% 10 parsecs, comparable to or smaller than this remnant size.
% Compare, Dame survey has beamwidth ~ 1/8 deg. = 7.5 arcmin = 450 arcsec

% TODO: check out ATCA J134649--625235, mentioned in Gaensler

% Summary / wrap-up
\citetalias{gaensler1998} and \citetalias{rakowski2001} have given the most
comprehensive radio and X-ray imaging studies of G309.2-0.6 to date.
Here, we study the spatially resolved X-ray remnant using archived XMM-Newton
observations.

\section{Observations and Data Reduction} \label{sec:obs}

XMM-Newton observed G309.2-0.6 for $97.7 \unit{ks}$ in two pointings
(Table~\ref{tab:obs}), which we hereafter reference by year.
The 2009 observation targeted the Be star HD 119682, but also captured
G309.2-0.6 on the MOS1/2 and PN detectors.
After background flare filtering, our good exposure times are $47 \unit{ks}$
for MOS1/2 and $27 \unit{ks}$ for PN.

% More verbose version
%XMM-Newton has observed G309.2-0.6 for $97.73 \unit{ks}$ in two pointings.

% Event lists, soft proton light curve filtering
We reduce the data with XMM's Science Analysis System (SAS) v15.0.0 and
Extended Science Analysis System (ESAS) v5.9 \citep{snowden2008, kuntz2008}.
\footnote{\href{http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xmm/esas/cookbook/xmm-esas.html}{http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xmm/esas/cookbook/xmm-esas.html}}
Event lists are created with SAS tasks \texttt{emchain} and \texttt{epchain}
(with \texttt{epchain} run twice to generate out-of-time events).
% TODO shorten emchain/epchain sentence
Strong soft proton flares are filtered by ESAS tasks \texttt{mos-filter} and
\texttt{pn-filter}, which fit a Gaussian to a histogram of time-binned count
rates for each exposure and discard time intervals where the count rate is
$1.5\sigma$ above the fitted Gaussian mean.  % TODO - sentence needs retooling
We further inspect the $2.5$--$12 \unit{keV}$ field-of-view light curves and
manually cut some brief good-time intervals surrounded by higher count rate
flares.
About half to two-thirds of each observation is lost to flares, with more
severe loss for PN exposures.
The resulting live times (good time intervals less CCD readout time) are
given in Table~\ref{tab:obs}.

% Point sources
We remove point sources with the ESAS task \texttt{cheese} and manually inspect
the masks to confirm removal of obvious point sources.
\textbf{TODO: merge pt source removal lists from both obsids}  %TODO
In particular, HD 119682 requires an exclusion mask $\sim 1\arcmin$ in radius.

% CCD exclusions
In obs. ID 0551000201, we excluded two MOS CCDs and the entire PN exposure from
our spectral analysis.
MOS2 CCD5 showed anomalously high soft X-ray background noise in its corner
counts \citep[cf.][]{kuntz2008}; MOS1 CCD6 was disabled by a presumed
micrometeorite in 2005.
The PN in Large Window mode does not collect corner counts, so we are unable to
estimate the detector background from ESAS tasks; moreover, the good time is
$\lesssim 10\%$ of our available exposures due to severe flare contamination.
% We do include PN counts in our non-background-subtracted broad- and
% narrow-band images.


\subsection{Spectrum Extraction and Modeling}

% Spectrum and QPB creation
Spectra are created from ``good'' single and double events (i.e.,
\texttt{PATTERN} $\leq 12,4$ for MOS, PN respectively; \texttt{FLAG} $= 0$ for
both MOS and PN), using ESAS tasks \texttt{\{mos,pn\}-spectra}.
We fit all spectra in XSPEC 12.9.0d \citep{arnaud1996}
using the T{\"u}bingen-Boulder solar elemental abundances
\citep{wilms2000}.
Our absorption model is \texttt{tbnew} v2.3.2
\footnote{http://pulsar.sternwarte.uni-erlangen.de/wilms/research/tbabs/},
which is the latest version of the gas absorption model discussed by
\citet{wilms2000}.

% QPB
The detector background is modeled by ESAS tasks \texttt{\{mos,pn\}\_back}
by (1) computing a quiescent spectrum from unexposed CCD corner counts,
(2) augmenting the quiescent spectrum with corner counts from public
observations with similar count rates and spectral hardness, and (3) scaling
the augmented quiescent spectrum shape to that expected for the source region
of interest, using the ratio of quiescent spectra across corner / source
regions from XMM's filter wheel closed observations and assuming that the ratio
of spectra across a given MOS or PN chip is time invariant.
See Sec. 3.4 of \citet{kuntz2008} for more detail and motivation.
\textbf{TODO: shorten this text}
% TODO this desperately needs to be shortened.
% but I do want make clear that this is a somewhat ad hoc model

% Instrumental lines
We model instrumental lines as zero-width, fixed-energy Gaussians and assume
that relative line strengths (i.e., line ratios) in a given CCD region are time
invariant, or, the same between FWC and observation data.
In spectrum fits, we use line normalizations from FWC data and vary a constant
prefactor for all instrumental lines in a given exposure.
For MOS exposures, we fit FWC spectra to two Gaussian lines at $1.49$ (Al) and
$1.75 \unit{keV}$ (Si) with a broken power-law continuum.
For PN, we fit seven Gaussian lines at $1.49$ (Al), $4.54$ (Ti), $5.44$ (Cr),
$7.49$ (Ni), $8.05$ (Cu), $8.62$ (Zn), and $8.90 \unit{keV}$ (Cu K-beta) with a
broken power-law continuum.
The PN Ti and Cr lines do not contribute significantly to observation spectra,
but are clearly visible in FWC spectra.

% SWCX
We neglect solar wind charge exchange (SWCX) emission, which affects a subset
of XMM-Newton observations \citep{snowden2004}.
The 2001 observation was not flagged by \citet{carter2011} as
containing time-variable soft X-ray emission indicative of exospheric SWCX,
% TODO what is the difference between these types of swcx?
Magnetospheric SWCX emissivity can be estimated by combining a magnetosphere
model \citep{spreiter1966} with Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) solar wind
velocity and density measurements, implemented via an online tool by the United
States XMM-Newton Guest Observer Facility (XMM GOF).
\footnote{\href{https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xmm/scripts/xmm_trend.html}{https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xmm/scripts/xmm\_trend.html}}
\textbf{TODO find better reference?}  % TODO revise text, too
During the Hughes observation, modeled SWCX emission decreases by a
factor of $10$.
We extracted 0087940201 MOS1 remnant spectra early and late in the observation
and, by eye, saw no obvious differences in soft X-ray emission.
% TODO I will be re-doing this.
The XMM GOF magnetosphere model additionally predicts weaker SWCX emission for
0551000201 compared to 0087940201.
We thus argue that SWCX can safely be neglected in both observations.
% TODO reword, too verbose

% NOTE: see my notes from 2016 Jan 13 on spectrum cuts to evaluate SWCX
% 0551000201 was observed March 2009
%   Carter/Sembay analysis performed August 2009, so 0551000201 was likely
%   still in its proprietary period
% 0087940201 is not listed in Carter/Sembay, but meets basic selection criteria
% (namely, MOS1/MOS2 operating in full frame mode

% Residual soft proton contamination
Residual soft protons dominate the X-ray background above $\sim 3 \unit{keV}$
and are not removed by flare filtering due to their slow time variation.
% TODO clarify
Spectra plotted in channel space show a constant count rate signal in the
highest energy bins that clearly cannot be modeled by any astrophysical source
-- a power law with index 0, folded through the effective area, falls off far
too rapidly to account for the observed signal.
The near constant nature of the noise is consistent with detector noise induced
by soft proton interaction.
We model residual soft protons by a power law not passed through CCD response
and effective area functions, following the ESAS prescription.

%Our X-ray sky background model comprises:

%(2) an absorbed thermal plasma from the hotter galactic halo, and
%(3) an absorbed power law for the unresolved extragalactic X-ray background
%(XSPEC model \texttt{apec + tbnew\_gas*(apec + powerlaw)}).
%We allow the background plasma temperatures and absorbing column to vary, but
%fix the extragalactic power law to index $1.4$ and normalization
%$10.9 \unit{cm^{-2}\, s^{-1}\, sr^{-1}\, keV^{-1}}$ \citep{hickox2006}.

%The X-ray background model has best fit local (unabsorbed) plasma
%local (unabsorbed) plasma at $0.262 \pm 0.07 \unit{keV}$,

%%The \texttt{apec} normalizations are $2.9\times10^{-4}$ and $2.6\times10^{-3}$

% ------------------------------------------

% CXRB caveats
A single equivalent column density absorption for both halo emission and the
extragalactic power law is unrealistic;
the galactic halo emission should be absorbed by a distance-averaged column,
whereas the extragalactic background is absorbed by all galactic gas along the
line of sight.
% TODO explain why we don't care about this
We also neglect low-level solar wind charge exchange (SWCX) contamination,
which may also vary between the two widely-separated XMM pointings.

% Parameter discussion
The galactic halo plasma's emission measure is within the expected range, but
its temperature is $\abt 2\times$ that deduced from high galactic
latitude XMM pointings \citep{henley2013}.
The absolute temperature discrepancy $\abt 2 \times 10^6 \unit{K}$ is larger
that expected for instrument calibration and statistical uncertainties
\citep{henley2015}.
However, the cloud shadowing measurements of \citet{henley2015} were also well
out of the galactic plane.
% TODO this makes no sense -- do we expect in-plane gas to be hotter?
% my first guess is yes -- gravitational infall = energy dissipation
% gravitational PE -> KE -> turbulent dissipation into heat, mixing etc
% but arguably if its in steady state -- say, convective and well-mixed
% this might be irrelevant. would need to calculate and compare heating/mixing
% timescales.

% SANITY check: do soft proton power law parameters show expected behavior?
% EXPECT: vignetted (lower norm), harder spectrum farther off-axis
% SP vignetting differs from the standard photon vignetting.
Soft proton parameters are tabulated
Although typically ignored, given the high XMM background levels we must verify
that parameters are reasonable.

\subsection{Annuli spectra}

We extract and fit spectra from five $100\arcsec$ wide annuli centered on the
remnant to discern how thermal plasma emission varies with remnant radius
(Figure~\ref{fig:regions}).
Each annulus is modeled by an absorbed NEI plasma
% TODO ensure NEI was acronym-defined earlier
% TODO write a shell script that checks for all acronyms and aggregates all
% lines where they occur, to ensure they have been properly defined
(XSPEC model \texttt{tbabs\_new * vnei}), with absorption column tied across
all five annuli.
The X-ray background is fixed to the integrated remnant fit model
(Section~\ref{sec:src-bkg}).
% TODO ensure PSF was acronym-defined earlier
We neglect redistribution of counts between annuli due to PSF wings as the
half-energy-enclosed width $\abt10$--$20\arcsec$ is much smaller than our
annuli widths.
Most emission is concentrated in 100\arcsec--300\arcsec.
Representative annulus spectra are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:annuli-spectra}

\begin{figure*}[]

\end{figure*}

The outer annulus (400-500\arcsec) fit is ill-constrained.
A fit with two sets of sky X-ray background parameters that agreed within error
yielded wildly divergent fits ($kT = 0.6$ vs. $10$, Si and S abundance $10$ vs.
$2$, ionization timescale $\tau = 1 \times 10^{10}$ vs. $5 \times 10^{13}$).
Only the silicon and sulfur lines can be attributed to the remnant; the rest of
the spectrum is dominated by background emission.
The outer annulus fit is NOT aided by addition of a nonthermal model.
It's just so dominated by background components already.
Give error bars here.
% TODO....
We perform subsequent fits with the inner four annuli only, although we show
representative fit values in Table~\ref{tab:annulus-fit}.
% TODO update fit parameters


% TODO fit outer annulus to just NEI -- check fit for ISM abundances.

Central emission from hot thermal plasma, with enhanced Si and S, suggests that
the reverse shock has traversed the entire remnant.

The central annulus shows soft X-ray ($<1 \unit{keV}$) excess that our
$\texttt{vnei}$ model with Si and S free cannot explain.
Mg emission is also reduced compared to the rest of the remnant.
In Table~\ref{tab:annulus-varycenter}, we explore combinations of non-solar
elemental abundances that might explain this central excess -- specifically,
Fe, O, and Ne.
Although additional elements improve the fit, it is not clear that any
combination of abundances fully explains the observed excess.
% TODO you should not be saying "by eye"...
% by eye, O emission appears to have the best shot.

The source of the central emission is uncertain.
Significant O line emission can be produced by SWCX, but the absence of soft
X-ray excess outside the central region disfavors this explanation (as we might
expect SWCX to fill the field of view).

% TODO fit center region to another NEI piece?

% SANITY check: do soft proton power law parameters show expected behavior?
% EXPECT: vignetted (lower norm), harder spectrum farther off-axis
% SP vignetting differs from the standard photon vignetting.
We also check soft proton parameters for the annuli.
Although they are not always strongly constrained in fitting, we find a
fall-off in soft proton contamination as a function of radial distance, which
appears consistent with off-axis vignetting.
% TODO citation
Plots and further information are given in Appendix~\ref{app:sp-annuli}.

%We should try the ESAS approach -- model SP everywhere far off-axis,

\paragraph{Discussion}

A \texttt{vnei} model fits the emission-weighted plasma to a single temperature
and ionization age, which may obscure spatial structure in temperature,
ionization, and ejecta abundances.
Nevertheless, we find that it gives a good initial fit to the remnant and
allows us to cleanly characterize the X-ray background.
From the integrated
The fit is most representative if the reverse shock has completely propagated
through the ejecta, ejecta abundances are well-mixed, and the thermal state of
the plasma does not show strong gradients.

Off-axis spectra are more difficult to interpret.
In the annulus fits, soft proton contamination scales with area,
but the actual sky photons do not increase as rapidly due to vignetting.
Basically, farther off-axis, we get more noise.
This compounds the fact that the remnant appears to be genuinely dimmer off
axis.

% Fit discrepancy wrt. Rakowski / Safi-Harb
Our fitted absorption column density $2.1 \times 10^{22} \unit{cm^{-2}}$ is
higher than $0.65 \times 10^{22} \unit{cm^{-2}}$ from a similar \texttt{vnei}
fit of the Hughes observation, briefly reported by \citet{safi-harb2007}.
\citet{safi-harb2007} freed O, Ne, Mg, Ar, Ca, Fe, and Ni abundances in
addition to Si and S and obtained qualitatively similar results (i.e.,
emission-weighted averaged plasma temperature $\abt 2 \unit{keV}$ and enhanced
Si and S abundances), so only column density is discrepant.
The reason for this is unclear, though we speculate that different background
treatment (modeling, subtraction) may play a role.
% See my notes: 2016 March 15-22
% with a somewhat older version of fitting code, but results should be about
% the same... I did not explore further by e.g. bounding elemental abundances

% Discussion: nH value discrepancies
We comment -- though it may be already obvious to the X-ray community -- that
our fitted absorption columns are significantly larger than those derived from
HI and dust maps \citep[e.g.,][]{willingale2013}.
For G309.2-0.6, the \textit{Swift} galactic $\nH$ calculator implementation of
\citet{willingale2013} provides an expected column density $1.81 \nHUnits$.
Dust scattering can bias X-ray spectrum fits of absorption alone to
overestimate the absorbing column by $\abt25\%$ \citep{corrales2016}.
% TODO -- possibly pull out their model and use it... cite randall2016 as well if needed
%Our absorption column estimate varies strongly with our model assumptions and
%spectrum extraction regions (Table~\ref{tab:fits}), but a 25\% overestimate of
%column density is consistent with our integrated remnant fit column of $2.1
%\nHUnits$.
% We're converging towards more stable values after having adequately
% characterized the X-ray background, added correct background
% scalings,incorporated power law component, etc...
The \textit{spectrum fit value} of $\nH$ may also be estimated from empirical
linear regression against optical extinction $\AV$ \citep[e.g.,][]{foight2015}
-- which benefits from a strong sampling of sources within the galactic plane,
and empirical validation -- but does not offer physical insight into the
discrepancy. We find approximate agreement ($2$--$3 \nHUnits$) with the various
relations.
\textbf{TODO: for now detailed accounting of absorption is beyond the scope of
this work, but may be revisited...}

\section{Morphology}

We resolve the bulk of SNR emission to a bright blob towards the north of the
remnant (assuming that the remnant may be delineated by the MOST contours),
part of a slightly dimmer ridge arcing towards the northwest.
The south is relatively dark.

\citetalias{rakowski2001} previously found an unresolved blob blended with the bright O
star.

So what?



If nH is low, we can still get reasonable kT and Si/S abundances
by driving down O,Ne,Fe emission. (based on north clump fits)
IF we force solar O/Ne/Fe, lower nH (below 2) quickly starts to look
unphysical.

north clump fit is ok not amazing.
SE dark gives OK fit with both Si/S solar...

Fits with: PN power law frozen, generally Si or both Si/S thawed



Balmer shocks taken as evidence for progenitor NOT photo-ionizing too much
stuff (requires neutral H ahead of shock).  So Balmer shocks at small radii can
be taken as evidence that the progenitor cannot have ionized "too much" stuff.
But, the absence of Balmer shocks doesn't tell us as much.
The shock could be weak, the density could be low, the material could be fully
ionized.


NOTE: SW lobe and ridge both show weird shifts in PN spectral lines (Si, S)
Details tbd (pending updates to plotting tools...)


\section{Discussion}

A comparative study could be interesting.

G352.7-0.1 (Pannuti+ 2014 2014ApJ...782..102P, XMM/Chandra) appears very
similar: we see a radio shell, somewhat center-filled X-rays (but not quite),
and more ejecta emission than would be expected for its age.

\section{Sky X-ray background modeling caveats}

The sky X-ray background may not be constant over scales of several arcminutes.
\citet{henley2013} modeled galactic halo emission using 110 XMM-Newton
observations well outside the galactic plane.
Most of their observations were widely separated, but a group of pointings
within $\abt 30\arcmin$ (labeled 103.1--103.27) showed halo temperature
variations $\abt 10$--$20\%$ and emission measure variation within a factor of
$\abt 2$.
% TODO I am totally just eyeballing the numbers right now -- not that useful.
% Possibly remove this.
% Henley 2013: looking at 28 clustered observations well out of the galactic
% plane, sightlines 103.1 to 103.27; 103.8 is two observations.
% SZE SurF project to complement SPT,APEX,ACT study.
Taking background from an annulus around the remnant should average out some
variation, although without knowing the power spectrum, we cannot say anything
quantitative.

The X-ray background parameters from our integrated source and background fit
may be biased by our assumption that a single-temperature NEI plasma adequately
describes integrated remnant emission.
To check this, we fit the background annulus alone, which removes this possible
bias but sacrifices background counts embedded in the source spectrum.
The resulting X-ray background parameters agree within error.
% TODO reference appendix table
